Here's a detailed description of the people in the photograph, based on my analysis:

**Foreground:**

*   **Primary Subject:** A woman is prominently featured in the foreground. She is wearing a dark, heavy coat, likely for warmth in the snowy conditions. She has a hat or head covering, and white gloves. She is holding a circular object above her head, possibly a wreath or decorative ring, with a white cloth or decoration attached. Her facial features are visible, and she appears to be looking off to the side.

**Background:**

*   **Distant Figures:** There are very faint, blurry figures in the far background, appearing as small, indistinct shapes. It's difficult to determine their gender or age due to the distance and lack of focus. They seem to be walking or standing in the snowy landscape.

**Overall:**

The photograph primarily focuses on the woman in the foreground. The figures in the background are too distant and blurry to provide any significant detail. It's safe to say there is at least one woman and potentially other people in the background, but their identities and details are unclear.
