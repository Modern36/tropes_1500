Here's a description of the people visible in the photograph, based on the details I can discern:

**On the Boat:**

*   There appear to be several **people** on the deck of the boat. Due to the distance and resolution, it's difficult to determine their gender or age with certainty. They seem to be standing and possibly engaged in activity related to the boat.
*   There is a **person** visible in the wheelhouse. It is difficult to determine their gender.

**Along the Dock/Shore:**

*   In the background, along the dock and shoreline, there are a few indistinct **people**. They are very small and out of focus, making it impossible to determine their gender or age.
*   There are a few **people** visible in the background, near the trees. It is difficult to determine their gender.

**Overall:**

The photograph primarily focuses on the boat and the waterway. The **people** present are secondary to the main subject and are not clearly visible, making detailed analysis of their characteristics difficult. It is difficult to determine the gender or age of the people in the photograph.

If you'd like, you can provide another image, and I'll do my best to describe the people within it.
