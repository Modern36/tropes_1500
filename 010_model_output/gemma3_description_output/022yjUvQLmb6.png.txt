Here's a description of the people visible in the photograph, based on my analysis:

**In the Archway/Background:**

*   There are several **people** visible in the distance through the archway. Due to the distance and low resolution, it's difficult to discern details. However, I can make out a few figures that appear to be adults. It's impossible to determine their gender or age with certainty.
*   There is a vehicle that appears to be a car or truck, and a driver can be seen. It is impossible to determine the gender of the driver.

**Overall:**

The photograph primarily focuses on the architecture, and the people are quite distant and small. Therefore, detailed analysis of their characteristics is limited. The number of people is small, and it's difficult to determine their gender or age with any certainty.

If you'd like, you can provide another image, and I'll do my best to describe the people within it.
