Here's a description of the people visible in the photograph, based on the details I can discern:

**Overall Impression:** The photograph appears to be taken from a high vantage point, likely aerial. Due to the distance and the image quality, it's challenging to provide detailed descriptions. However, I can identify a small group of people near the main building.

**People near the building:**

*   There are approximately 5-7 people visible in front of the main building. They appear to be gathered in a circular area, possibly a garden or courtyard.
*   It is difficult to determine their gender or age due to the distance and resolution. They appear as small figures, and their clothing is not distinct enough to make a clear determination. They could be a mix of men, women, and children.

**Background:**

*   There are no other discernible people in the background or surrounding areas. The landscape is dominated by trees, fields, and other buildings.

**Limitations:**

*   The image quality and distance make it difficult to provide more detailed descriptions of the people.
*   It's impossible to determine their activities or relationships based on the image alone.

**In summary,** there is a small group of people near the main building, but their gender, age, and activities are difficult to determine due to the limitations of the image.
