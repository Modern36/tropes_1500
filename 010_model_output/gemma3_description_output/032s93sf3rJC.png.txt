Here's a detailed description of the people in the photograph, as best as can be determined:

**Foreground/Main Focus:**

*   **Person 1 (Left):** An older person, likely a man, wearing a hat and a long coat. They are holding a cane and appear to be walking with a slight stoop.
*   **Person 2 (Center-Left):** A person wearing a jacket and trousers. It's difficult to determine gender, but the clothing suggests a more masculine style.
*   **Person 3 (Center):** A young person, likely a boy, wearing a cap, jacket, and trousers. They are carrying a bundle of branches.
*   **Person 4 (Center-Right):** A young person, likely a girl, wearing a jacket and a skirt. They are carrying a bundle of branches.
*   **Person 5 (Right):** A young person, likely a girl, wearing a jacket and a skirt. They are carrying a bundle of branches.

**Background:**

*   There are several other people in the background, but they are out of focus and difficult to discern. They appear to be wearing similar clothing to those in the foreground. It is difficult to determine their gender or age.

**Overall:**

The photograph appears to depict a group of people, including men, women, and children, carrying branches. The clothing suggests that the photograph was taken in the early 20th century. It is difficult to provide a more detailed description of the people due to the low resolution and lack of focus.
