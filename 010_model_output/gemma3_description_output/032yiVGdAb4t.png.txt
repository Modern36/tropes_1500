Here's a description of the people visible in the photograph, based on the details I can discern:

**Foreground/Midground:**

*   There are no people clearly visible in the immediate foreground or midground, except for the large animal which is the focus of the image.

**Background:**

*   **Two people** are visible in the background, standing near a fence or barrier. They appear to be wearing long dresses or coats, suggesting they could be women. It's difficult to determine their age or other details due to the distance and image quality.
*   **One person** is standing further back, near a building. They appear to be wearing a long coat or dress, and it is difficult to determine their gender or age.

**Overall:**

The people in the photograph are distant and somewhat indistinct. Based on the clothing, it's likely that at least some of them are women, but it's difficult to make definitive determinations about gender or age. The focus of the image is clearly on the large animal in the foreground.
