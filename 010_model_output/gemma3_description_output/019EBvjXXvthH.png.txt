Here's a description of the people visible in the photograph, based on the details I can discern:

*   **Person near the right side of the image:** There is a person standing near the right side of the image, wearing what appears to be a coat or dress. Based on the clothing and silhouette, it is likely a woman.
*   **People in the distance:** There are a few indistinct figures in the distance, near the storefronts. It's difficult to determine their gender or age due to the distance and low resolution. They appear to be people walking or standing.
*   **Possible person near the left side:** There is a very faint, blurry figure near the left side of the image, near the corner of the building. It is difficult to determine if this is a person or an object.

It's important to note that due to the age and quality of the photograph, it's challenging to provide a definitive analysis of the people present. The details are limited, and interpretations are based on the available visual cues.
