Here's a detailed description of the people in the photograph:

**Foreground:**

*   **Person 1:** This person appears to be a woman. She is wearing a long, light-colored gown with a detailed bodice. She has a delicate necklace and is holding a closed fan. Her hair is styled in an elaborate updo, possibly a wig or heavily styled hair, and adorned with what appears to be flowers or ribbons.
*   **Person 2:** This person appears to be a man. He is wearing a dark, formal coat with decorative trim, breeches (short pants), and stockings. He has a white wig and a ruffled cravat at his neck. His hands are clasped in front of him.

**Background:**

*   There are no other people clearly visible in the background. The background consists of steps and some foliage, but it is out of focus and does not contain any discernible people.

**Overall:**

The two people in the foreground are dressed in what appears to be historical or theatrical costumes, likely from the 18th century. Their attire suggests they may be portraying characters from that era.
