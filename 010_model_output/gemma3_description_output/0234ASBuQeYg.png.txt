Here's a description of the people in the photograph, based on the details visible:

**Primary Subject:**

*   There is one clearly visible person in the photograph. This person appears to be a **woman**. She is older, with her hair pulled back. She is wearing a dress with a patterned apron over it, and dark shoes. She is actively engaged with a large, woven structure.

**Background/Other People:**

*   It's difficult to determine if there are any other people in the background. The image is somewhat grainy and the background is cluttered with furniture and objects. There are no clear figures visible, so it's impossible to say if anyone else is present.

**Overall:**

The photograph primarily features one older woman, who is the main subject and appears to be working with a large woven structure. There is no evidence of other people in the image.
