Here's a description of the people in the photograph, based on the details visible:

**Foreground:**

*   There is one clearly visible **woman** in the foreground. She is wearing a long dress and a head covering, which was common attire for women in many cultures during the time this photograph was likely taken. She is actively working with some wooden pieces on a makeshift table.

**Background:**

*   There are some indistinct figures in the background, near what appear to be structures. It is difficult to determine their gender or age due to the distance and lack of detail. They appear to be **people** engaged in some activity, possibly building or repairing structures.

**Overall:**

The photograph primarily features one woman as the central figure, with a few other people visible in the background. The clothing of the woman suggests a specific cultural context and time period.
