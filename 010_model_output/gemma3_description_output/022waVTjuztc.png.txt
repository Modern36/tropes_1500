Here's a description of the people in the photograph, based on the details visible:

**Primary Subject:**

*   There is one clearly visible person in the photograph.
*   This person appears to be a **woman**. This is determined by her clothing, specifically the style of the dress/suit and the accessories (hat, shoes). The clothing style is consistent with women's fashion of the early to mid-20th century.
*   She is standing in a three-quarter pose, facing slightly to the left.
*   She is wearing a matching suit with a jacket and a knee-length skirt.
*   She is wearing a hat and gloves.
*   She is carrying a small handbag.
*   Her shoes appear to be open-toed sandals.

**Background:**

*   There are no other people visible in the background. The background is a simple, dark wall and a patterned floor.

It's important to note that this assessment is based solely on visual cues from the photograph. Without additional context, it's impossible to be 100% certain about the person's identity or any other details about them.
