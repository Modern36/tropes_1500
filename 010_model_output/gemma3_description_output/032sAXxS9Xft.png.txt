Here's a description of the people visible in the photograph, based on the details I can discern:

**Overall Impression:** The photograph is a high-angle view, making it difficult to discern individual details. The people appear very small and are scattered throughout the scene.

**Specific Observations:**

*   **Around the Main Building:** There are numerous small figures around the large building. It's difficult to determine gender, but they appear to be people walking along the grounds and near the roads.
*   **Near the Roads:** There are a few figures that appear to be walking or standing near the roads. Again, it's hard to determine gender.
*   **In the Gardens/Fields:** There are a few very small figures in the garden/field areas, likely people working or tending to the land.
*   **Around the Houses:** There are a few figures around the houses, but they are too small to determine gender or activity.

**Gender/Age Estimation:**

*   Due to the distance and resolution, it's almost impossible to reliably determine the gender or age of most of the people.
*   Based on the size and general shape, some figures *might* be children, but this is highly speculative.
*   Most figures are likely adults, but it's impossible to say with certainty.

**In summary:** The photograph shows a number of people scattered throughout the scene, but their small size and the distance make it very difficult to provide detailed descriptions or determine their gender or age. It's safe to say there are both adults and potentially some children present.
