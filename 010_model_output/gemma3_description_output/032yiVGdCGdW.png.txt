Here's a description of the people in the photograph, based on my analysis:

The photograph appears to be a street scene with a building corner as the main subject. Upon careful examination, I can identify a few people:

*   **Person near the entrance:** There is a person standing in the doorway of the building. It is difficult to determine their gender or age due to the distance and image quality.
*   **Person on the sidewalk:** There is a person walking on the sidewalk, partially visible. It is difficult to determine their gender or age due to the distance and image quality.
*   **People in the background:** There are a few indistinct figures in the background, likely pedestrians. It is impossible to determine their gender or age due to the distance and image quality.

Overall, the photograph does not prominently feature people, and those present are mostly indistinct and difficult to analyze in detail.
