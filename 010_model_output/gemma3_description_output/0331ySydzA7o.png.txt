Here's a description of the people in the photograph, based on my analysis:

There appear to be two people visible in the photograph.

*   **Person 1:** This person is standing behind a counter, likely working. It is difficult to determine their gender due to the distance and the quality of the image. They appear to be wearing a light-colored shirt or uniform.
*   **Person 2:** This person is standing near the counter, possibly interacting with the first person. It is also difficult to determine their gender.

It's important to note that due to the image quality and distance, these are estimations based on the visible features. It's challenging to provide more detailed descriptions or definitively identify genders.
