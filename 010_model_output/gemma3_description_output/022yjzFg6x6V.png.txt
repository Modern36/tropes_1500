Here's a description of the people visible in the photograph, based on my analysis:

**Overall Impression:** The photograph appears to be a wide shot of a church and surrounding area. Due to the distance and the quality of the image, identifying individuals is challenging. However, I can make out a few figures.

**Specific Observations:**

*   **Near the Church:** There are several very small figures near the church and in the graveyard. It is difficult to determine their gender or age due to their size and distance. They appear to be people tending to the graves or walking around the church grounds.
*   **Background:** In the distant background, there are a few very small, indistinct figures near what appear to be houses. Again, it's impossible to determine their gender or age.

**Limitations:**

*   The image is a wide shot, and the people are very small and distant.
*   The image is in black and white, making it difficult to discern details like clothing that might indicate gender.
*   The image quality is not high, making it difficult to see details.

**In conclusion:** There are a few people visible in the photograph, but it is difficult to determine their gender or age due to the distance and image quality. They appear to be people associated with the church and surrounding area.
