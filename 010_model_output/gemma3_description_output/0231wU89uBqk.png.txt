Here's a description of the people visible in the photograph, based on the details I can discern:

Due to the aerial perspective and the age of the photograph, it's extremely difficult to make out individual people with certainty. However, I can identify a few possible instances of people:

*   **Near the buildings:** There are several small, dark shapes near the buildings along the road. These could potentially be people, but they are very small and indistinct. It's impossible to determine their gender or age.
*   **Around the buildings:** There are a few more dark shapes around the buildings, which could be people. Again, it's impossible to determine their gender or age.
*   **In the fields:** There are a few very small, dark shapes in the fields, which could be people working. It's impossible to determine their gender or age.

Overall, the photograph does not provide enough detail to identify any people with certainty. The shapes that could be people are very small and indistinct, and it's impossible to determine their gender or age.

It's important to note that this is just an estimate based on the available information. It's possible that some of the shapes are not people, or that there are people in the photograph that I have not been able to identify.
