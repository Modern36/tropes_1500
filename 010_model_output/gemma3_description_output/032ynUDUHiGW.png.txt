Here's a description of the people visible in the photograph, with as much detail as possible:

**Foreground & Midground:**

*   **Man pulling a cart:** A man is prominently visible pulling a two-wheeled cart. He appears to be wearing a cap and a coat. The cart is loaded with what appear to be boxes or containers.
*   **Man in the cart:** A man is sitting in the cart, possibly overseeing the load.
*   **Driver of the vehicle:** A person is driving the vehicle in the foreground, but their features are obscured.
*   **People walking:** Several people are walking along the side of the road. Most appear to be men, judging by their clothing (coats and hats). It's difficult to determine the gender of some of the more distant figures.
*   **People in the background:** A group of people are walking in the background, near the wall covered in posters. They are mostly indistinct, but appear to be a mix of men and possibly some women.

**General Observations:**

*   The photograph appears to depict a busy street scene, likely in an urban area.
*   The people are dressed in clothing typical of the era (likely early to mid-20th century), with coats, hats, and relatively formal attire.
*   It's difficult to determine the exact number of people in the photograph due to the blur and distance of some figures. However, there are at least a dozen people visible.
*   There are no children clearly visible in the photograph.

It's important to note that these observations are based on the limited information available in the photograph. It's difficult to be certain about the gender or age of some of the figures due to the image quality and distance.
