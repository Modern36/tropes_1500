Here's a description of the people visible in the photograph, based on my analysis:

**In the Boat:**

*   There appear to be **two people** in the boat. Due to the distance and the image quality, it's difficult to determine their gender with certainty. However, based on the visible forms, it's possible one is a **man** and the other a **person**. They are both seated and appear to be engaged in some activity, possibly navigating or fishing.

**Background:**

*   There is a faint outline of **a person** in the background, near the buildings. It is difficult to determine their gender or age due to the distance and low resolution.

**Overall:**

The photograph primarily focuses on the boat and the surrounding environment. The people are secondary elements, and their details are limited. It's challenging to provide a comprehensive description due to the image quality and the distance of the subjects.
