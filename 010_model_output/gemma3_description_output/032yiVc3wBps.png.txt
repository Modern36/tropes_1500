Here's a description of the people visible in the photograph, based on the details I can discern:

**Foreground:**

*   There is one clearly visible **person** standing next to a truck. Based on the clothing and build, this person appears to be a **man**. He is wearing a long coat and a cap. He is carrying a large, rolled-up object, possibly a tarp or blanket.

**Background:**

*   It is difficult to determine if there are any people in the background. The buildings are the main focus, and any figures would be very small and indistinct. It is possible there are people inside the buildings, but it is impossible to confirm from this image.

**Overall:**

The photograph primarily features one identifiable **man** in the foreground. The image does not provide enough detail to identify any other people.
