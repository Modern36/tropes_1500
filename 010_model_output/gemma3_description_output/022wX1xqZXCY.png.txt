Here's a description of the people in the photograph, based on my analysis:

**Foreground:**

*   There is a sculpted figure of a person, appearing to be a woman, reclining on a pedestal. The figure is nude, and its features suggest a female form.

**Background:**

*   A partial figure of a person is visible on the left side of the image. This person is wearing a long dress, suggesting it is a woman.

**Overall:**

The photograph primarily features a sculpted figure of a woman, with a partial view of another woman in the background. It's difficult to determine if there are any other people present due to the focus and composition of the image.
