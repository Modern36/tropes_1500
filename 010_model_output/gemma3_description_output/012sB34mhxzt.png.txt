Here's a detailed description of the people in the photograph:

**Overall:** The photograph features three people, appearing to be a family or a group posing for a portrait. They are all dressed in clothing styles typical of the early 20th century.

**Individual Descriptions:**

*   **Person 1 (Standing, Back):** This person appears to be a young man. He is wearing a dark suit with a tie. His hair is neatly styled. He is standing behind the other two people.
*   **Person 2 (Seated, Center):** This person appears to be a young woman or girl. She is seated in a chair and wearing a patterned dress with white socks and shoes. Her hair is styled in waves.
*   **Person 3 (Seated, Right):** This person appears to be a young woman. She is seated next to the other seated person and wearing a light-colored dress with white socks and shoes. She is also wearing a necklace. Her hair is styled in waves.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The clothing styles suggest the photograph was taken in the 1920s or 1930s.
*   The people are all looking directly at the camera, which was common for formal portraits of the time.
*   The background is a simple, patterned wall, which was also typical for studio portraits.

If you'd like, you can provide another photograph, and I'll do my best to describe the people in it.
