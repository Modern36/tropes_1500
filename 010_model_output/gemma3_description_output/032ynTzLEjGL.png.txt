Here's a description of the people visible in the photograph, based on my analysis:

There appear to be **three people** visible in the photograph. They are standing near the building on the right side of the image.

*   **Person 1:** Appears to be a **man**, standing near the front of the building.
*   **Person 2:** Appears to be a **man**, standing next to the first person.
*   **Person 3:** Appears to be a **man**, standing further back, partially obscured by the building.

It's difficult to provide more detailed descriptions due to the distance and the image quality. However, based on their posture and the clothing visible, they appear to be adult males.

It's important to note that this is an interpretation based on limited visual information.
