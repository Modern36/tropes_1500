Okay, I've examined the photograph carefully. Due to the high angle and distance, it's extremely difficult to discern any individual people with certainty. However, I can make the following observations:

*   **Near the buildings:** There are a few very small, dark shapes near the buildings. These could potentially be people, but they are so small and indistinct that it's impossible to confirm. It's also possible they are animals or objects.
*   **Along the shoreline:** There appears to be a very small, dark shape near the shoreline. It is too small to determine if it is a person.
*   **General absence:** Overall, the photograph appears to be devoid of any clearly visible people. The high angle and distance make it very difficult to identify any human figures.

**In conclusion:** While there are a few very small, indistinct shapes that *could* be people, it's impossible to confirm their presence or identify their gender or age with any certainty. The photograph does not provide enough detail to reliably identify any people.
