Here's a description of the people in the photograph, based on your instructions:

**Main Subject:**

The photograph prominently features one person, a woman. She is captured in a profile view, seated. Her hair is styled in a short, wavy bob, typical of the 1920s-1930s. She is wearing a dark-colored, likely wool, dress or top with a simple neckline. Her expression is neutral and she appears to be looking off to the side.

**Background:**

The background is dark and out of focus, making it difficult to discern any other people or details. It appears to be a studio setting with a draped backdrop.

**Overall:**

The photograph focuses solely on the woman, and there are no other discernible people present in the image.
