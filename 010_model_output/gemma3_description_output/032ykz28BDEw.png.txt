Here's a description of the people in the photograph, based on my analysis:

**Primary Subject:**

*   There is one clearly visible person, an elderly woman. She is seated in a chair and appears to be the main subject of the photograph. She is wearing a dark, long-sleeved dress and a head covering. Her facial features are visible, showing her age and expression.

**People in the Background/Within Objects:**

*   Within the framed pictures on the wall, there are depictions of people. These appear to be portraits of families or individuals, but the details are too small to determine gender or age with certainty.
*   There is a small statue of a person on the table.

**Overall:**

The photograph primarily features one elderly woman. There are also depictions of people within the framed pictures on the wall, and a statue of a person.
