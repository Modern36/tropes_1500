Okay, I've examined the photograph carefully.

Based on my analysis, I can identify **two people** in the image.

*   **Person 1:** Located on the left side of the image, near the corner of the building. This person appears to be standing and is partially obscured by the building. It is difficult to determine gender or age due to the distance and low resolution.
*   **Person 2:** Located on the right side of the image, near the corner of the building. This person appears to be standing and is partially obscured by the building. It is difficult to determine gender or age due to the distance and low resolution.

It's important to note that due to the image quality and the distance of these figures, it's difficult to provide more detailed descriptions or confidently identify their gender or age. They are quite small and indistinct within the scene.
