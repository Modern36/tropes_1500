Here's a description of the people visible in the photograph, based on the details I can discern:

**Overall Impression:** The photograph appears to be a high-angle or aerial view of a village or town centered around a church. Due to the distance and the image quality, identifying individuals is very difficult. However, I can make out a few small figures.

**Specific Observations:**

*   **Around the Church:** There are several very small figures scattered around the church and in the immediate vicinity. These appear to be people, but it's impossible to determine their gender or age. They are likely congregants or villagers.
*   **Near Buildings:** I can see a few more figures near some of the buildings surrounding the church. Again, it's impossible to determine their gender or age.
*   **In the Fields:** There are a couple of very small figures in the fields surrounding the village. These could be farmers or people working in the fields.

**Limitations:**

*   The distance and low resolution make it impossible to discern any specific details about the people, such as their clothing, facial features, or activities.
*   It's difficult to determine the exact number of people present in the photograph.

**In summary,** the photograph shows a small number of people scattered around the village, but it's impossible to provide any detailed information about them. They appear to be villagers or people working in the surrounding fields.
