Here's a description of the people visible in the photograph, with as much detail as possible, focusing on gender and age where discernible:

**Overall Impression:** The photograph depicts a busy train platform, and there are numerous people present, mostly clustered around the trains. Due to the distance and the quality of the photograph, detailed individual descriptions are difficult.

**Detailed Observations:**

*   **Platform near Trains:** A large group of people are gathered around the trains. Most appear to be adults, with a mix of men and women. Many are wearing coats and hats, typical for the era. It's difficult to distinguish children within this group, but some smaller figures may be present.
*   **Along the Platform Edge:** Several people are standing along the edge of the platform, seemingly waiting for or seeing off passengers. Again, a mix of men and women, dressed in coats and hats.
*   **Background Figures:** In the background, near the buildings, there are more indistinct figures. These are likely people walking or waiting, but it's difficult to determine their gender or age.
*   **Near the Entrance:** Near the entrance to the station, there are a few people standing or walking. These appear to be a mix of men and women.
*   **General Clothing:** The clothing suggests a time period of the 1930s. Most people are wearing coats, hats, and dresses or suits. This makes it difficult to determine gender in some cases.

**Estimates:**

*   **Men:** Approximately 20-25
*   **Women:** Approximately 20-25
*   **Children:** Difficult to determine, but likely a few present (perhaps 5-10)
*   **People whose gender/age is indeterminate:** Approximately 10-15

**Important Note:** These are estimates based on the available visual information. It's difficult to be precise due to the distance, quality, and historical context of the photograph.
