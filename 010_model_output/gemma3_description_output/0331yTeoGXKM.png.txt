Here's a description of the people visible in the photograph, based on the details I can discern:

Due to the aerial perspective and the age of the photograph, the people are very small and difficult to distinguish clearly. However, I can identify a few individuals and groups:

*   **Near the railway tracks:** There are several small figures near the railway tracks, appearing to be working or moving around the area. It's difficult to determine their gender or age, but they appear to be adults.
*   **Around the buildings:** There are a few more figures around the buildings, possibly workers or supervisors. Again, it's hard to determine their gender or age.
*   **In the open areas:** There are a few very small figures in the open areas between the buildings, possibly moving between different parts of the complex.

Overall, the people appear to be primarily adults, likely workers at the industrial complex. It's impossible to determine the exact number of people or their specific activities with this level of detail. There are no visible children or women.

It's important to note that these observations are based on limited visual information and may not be entirely accurate.
