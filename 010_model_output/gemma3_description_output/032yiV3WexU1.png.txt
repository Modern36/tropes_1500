*   **Two Women (depicted on posters):** The most prominent "people" are two women featured on advertising posters.
    *   The first woman is depicted in a head and shoulders portrait, wearing a headscarf and a brooch. She appears to be middle-aged or older.
    *   The second woman is also depicted in a head and shoulders portrait, wearing a headscarf. She appears to be younger.

**Background:**

*   It's difficult to determine if there are any other people in the background. The image is focused on the products and posters, and the background is largely obscured by shelves and other items.

**Overall:**

The photograph primarily features representations of women through advertising. There is no clear evidence of any other people being present in the scene.
