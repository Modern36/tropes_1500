Here's a description of the people in the photograph, based on my analysis:

**Primary Subject:**

*   There is one clearly visible person standing in front of the building. Based on the clothing and posture, this appears to be a **man**. He is wearing what looks like a suit jacket and trousers, and possibly a hat.

**Background/Other People:**

*   It's difficult to discern any other people in the background due to the focus and the density of the foliage. There are no other clearly defined figures.

**Overall:**

The photograph primarily features one identifiable person, a man, who is the main subject in front of the building. There are no other discernible people in the image.
