Okay, I've examined the photograph carefully.

Based on my analysis, I can identify a few **people** on the rooftops of the buildings. They appear as small, dark figures.

*   On the rooftop of the building on the left, there appears to be a **person** standing near the edge. It's difficult to determine gender or age due to the distance and resolution.
*   On the rooftop of the building in the center, there are two **people** visible. One appears to be standing and the other is partially obscured. Again, it's impossible to determine their gender or age.
*   On the rooftop of the building on the right, there appears to be a **person** standing near the edge. It's difficult to determine gender or age due to the distance and resolution.

It's important to note that these are small figures and the details are limited. I cannot confidently determine their gender, age, or any other specific characteristics. They are simply identifiable as human figures within the scene.

I have scanned the entire image, including the background, and these are the only figures I can identify.
