Here's a detailed description of the people in the photograph, as best as can be determined:

**Foreground:**

*   **Person operating the telescope:** This person is the most prominent figure. They appear to be a man, based on the cut of their suit and the shape of their face. They are wearing a light-colored suit with a patterned tie, and a cap. They are actively looking through a large telescope mounted on a tripod.
*   **Person to the right of the telescope:** This person is partially visible, and appears to be a man. They are wearing a cap and a light-colored suit.
*   **Person to the left of the telescope:** This person is partially visible, and appears to be a man. They are wearing a cap and a light-colored suit.

**Background:**

*   **Person in uniform:** Standing to the far left is a person wearing a dark uniform with a cap. Based on the cut and style, this person appears to be a man.
*   **Person in the middle background:** Behind the person operating the telescope, there is another person wearing a cap and a light-colored suit. It is difficult to determine their gender with certainty, but they appear to be a man.
*   **Person in the far background:** There is a person in the far background, but they are out of focus and difficult to discern. It is impossible to determine their gender or any other details.

**Overall:**

The photograph appears to feature primarily men, based on their clothing and visible features. There are at least five people visible in the photograph, with varying degrees of clarity. It is difficult to determine the exact number of people present, as some may be partially hidden or out of focus.
