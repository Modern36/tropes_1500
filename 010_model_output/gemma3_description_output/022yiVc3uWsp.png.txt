Here's a description of the people in the photograph, based on my analysis:

**Overall Impression:** The photograph appears to depict an exhibition or display within a large hall. The primary focus is on the arrangement of artwork on the walls and the rows of chairs set up in front of them.

**People Present:**

*   **Limited Number of Visible People:** There are very few people visible in the photograph.
*   **Background Figures:** In the background, near the center of the image, there are a few indistinct figures. It's difficult to determine their gender or age due to the distance and lack of detail. They appear to be standing and possibly observing the artwork.
*   **Possible Figures in the Distance:** There might be a few more people in the very back of the hall, but they are too small and blurry to make out any details.
*   **No Children Visible:** There are no clear indications of children being present in the photograph.
*   **Gender Ambiguity:** Due to the distance and lack of detail, it's difficult to determine the gender of the people in the background with certainty. They could be men, women, or a mix of both.

**In summary:** The photograph primarily focuses on the exhibition space and the arrangement of artwork. The number of people present is limited, and their details are difficult to discern due to the distance and lack of focus. It's challenging to provide a detailed description of their gender or age based on the available information.
