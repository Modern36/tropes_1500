Here's a description of the people visible in the photograph, with as much detail as possible:

*   **Two cyclists:** There are two people riding bicycles on the road. It's difficult to determine their gender with certainty due to the image quality and distance, but based on the clothing, they appear to be women.
*   **Person in the distance:** There is a person walking in the far distance on the left side of the road. It is difficult to determine their gender or age due to the distance and image quality.

It's important to note that due to the limitations of the image quality and distance, these are estimations based on the available visual information.
