Here's a detailed description of the people in the photograph:

**Overall Impression:** The photograph depicts a group of individuals, all appearing to be adult men, standing in a grassy field. They are uniformly dressed in what appears to be military or official uniforms.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

*   **Main Group (Center & Foreground):** There are approximately 12-15 men gathered in a semi-circle. They are all wearing similar uniforms consisting of jackets, trousers, and hats. Some have what appear to be pouches or bags slung over their shoulders. Their facial features are somewhat indistinct due to the photograph's age and quality, but they all appear to be adult males.
*   **Background:** In the distant background, there are some indistinct figures that appear to be people, but they are too far away and out of focus to provide any specific details. They seem to be standing near a line of trees.

**Gender:** Based on the clothing and visible features, all the people in the photograph appear to be men.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The uniformity of the clothing suggests that these individuals are part of a military unit, an official organization, or a group with a shared purpose.
*   The setting (a grassy field) suggests an outdoor activity or training exercise.
*   The photograph's age and quality make it difficult to discern fine details, but the overall impression is of a group of men in a formal or official setting.
