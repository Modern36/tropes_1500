Here's a detailed description of the people in the photograph:

**Main Subjects:**

*   There are two people in the photograph, both appearing to be young women.
*   **Woman on the left:** She has a classic hairstyle of the era, with waves or curls framing her face. She is wearing a dark-colored dress with a low neckline and a string of pearls around her neck. Her expression is somewhat serious and she is looking off to the side.
*   **Woman on the right:** She has shorter, darker hair and is wearing a plaid shirt or blouse with a white collar. Her expression is also serious, and she is looking towards the camera.

**Overall Impression:**

The photograph appears to be a portrait taken in a studio setting. The lighting is soft, and the background is a neutral tone. The women's clothing and hairstyles suggest that the photograph was taken in the 1930s or 1940s.

**Additional Notes:**

*   There are no other people visible in the photograph.
*   The focus is primarily on the two women, and they are both relatively clear and well-defined.

If you'd like, you can share another photograph, and I'll do my best to describe the people in it.
