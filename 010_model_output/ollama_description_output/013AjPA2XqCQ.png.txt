The photograph features a single individual, a baby girl sitting on what appears to be a sheepskin rug or fur coat. The child has short blonde hair and is dressed in a white dress with lace trim and a bow at the collar. She holds a stuffed animal, possibly a teddy bear, in her right hand.

In the background, there are no other people visible. However, it's worth noting that the photograph may have been taken indoors, as suggested by the presence of the rug or fur coat and the lack of any outdoor elements such as trees or buildings.

Overall, the photograph captures a sweet and innocent moment of childhood, with the baby girl being the sole focus of attention.
