There do not appear to be any people in this photograph. The image shows a house with a tiled roof, surrounded by trees and bushes. In front of the house is a gravel path leading to a gate, which appears to be made of wood or metal. To the left of the house is a small garden or yard, with what looks like a few flowers or plants growing in it.

In the background, there are several trees and bushes that appear to be part of a larger landscape or forest. The sky above is overcast, giving the scene a somewhat gloomy atmosphere. Overall, the photograph suggests a peaceful and serene setting, possibly from a rural area or countryside location.
