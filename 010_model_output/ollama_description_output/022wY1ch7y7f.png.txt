The photograph depicts a group of young girls posing for a class photo. The girls are all dressed in dark-colored dresses with light-colored blouses underneath, and they wear their hair in braids or buns. They sit on benches arranged in rows, with the tallest girls standing behind them.

In the background, there is a chalkboard on the wall with some writing on it that appears to be Swedish text. A teacher stands at the back of the room, overseeing the students. The overall atmosphere suggests a formal school setting from the early 20th century.

There are no other people visible in the photograph beyond the girls and their teacher. The focus is solely on this group of young students gathered for a class picture.
