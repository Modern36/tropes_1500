There are no people visible in this photograph.

The image depicts a train car being lifted by a crane, with a group of men standing on the platform next to it. The men are wearing dark-colored clothing and hats, which suggests that they may be workers or laborers involved in the loading or unloading process. However, due to the low resolution of the image, it is difficult to determine their exact occupations or roles.

In addition to the men on the platform, there appears to be another person standing near the train car, possibly operating the crane or supervising the operation. This individual is also wearing dark-colored clothing and a hat, but their face is not clearly visible due to the distance and poor lighting conditions.

Overall, while there are several people present in the image, they are all male and appear to be involved in some capacity with the train car and its contents.
