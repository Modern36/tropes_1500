There are two people visible on the train in this photograph. They are standing at the top of a freight car, but it's impossible to determine any further details as they are too far away and not clearly defined.

The image is mostly focused on a train with several cars, including a locomotive and freight cars. The train appears to be moving along tracks that run through a rural or industrial area. In the background, there are some trees and buildings visible, but they are not clearly defined due to the distance and quality of the photograph.

Overall, while there are two people present in the image, they are not the main focus of the photograph and do not provide any significant information about their identities or activities.
