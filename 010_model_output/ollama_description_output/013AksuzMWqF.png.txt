There are no people visible in this photograph. The image depicts a serene scene of two boats on the water, with one boat appearing to be docked at a pier or marina while the other is positioned further away from the shore. The background features trees and houses along the shoreline, creating a peaceful atmosphere.

Since there are no individuals present in the picture, it is not possible to determine their gender based on clothing or any other characteristics. Therefore, I will refrain from making any assumptions about the presence of people in this image.
