The photograph features two individuals standing beside a bus, with one person positioned behind the other. The individual at the front is dressed in dark attire and appears to be wearing a hat or head covering, making it challenging to discern any defining facial features. 

Behind this person stands another individual, who seems to be wearing lighter-colored clothing and possibly a lighter hat or head covering. However, due to the positioning of their bodies and the limited visibility caused by the front individual's attire, it is difficult to determine any distinctive facial characteristics for this person as well.

In the background, there are no other people visible within the photograph.
