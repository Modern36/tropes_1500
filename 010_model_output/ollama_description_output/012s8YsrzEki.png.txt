The image shows two women standing on a pier, looking out at the water. The woman on the left is wearing a white dress with short sleeves and a knee-length skirt. She has dark hair pulled back into a bun and is holding a hat in her right hand. The woman on the right is wearing a light-colored dress with long sleeves and a longer skirt. She also has dark hair, but it's styled differently than the other woman.

In the background, there are several buildings visible along the waterfront. There appears to be a boat or ship docked at one of the piers, but it's not clear from this angle. The sky above is overcast, with clouds covering most of the sun.

Overall, the scene suggests that these women may have been waiting for someone arriving by boat or simply enjoying the view together. They seem to be engaged in conversation, possibly discussing their plans for the day ahead.
