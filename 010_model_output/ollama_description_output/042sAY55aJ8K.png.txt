The photograph shows a close-up portrait of a woman with a neutral expression, looking directly at the camera. The woman has short dark hair styled in a side parting swept back and tucked behind her ear on one side. She wears light makeup, including lipstick, blush and mascara, and pearl earrings. Her face is framed by a dark fur coat collar that covers her shoulders and neck.

There are no other people visible in the photograph; the focus is solely on this single subject. The background is out of focus, but it appears to be a plain wall or backdrop behind the woman, with some subtle shading suggesting texture or shadowing effects from lighting during photography.
