There are no individuals visible anywhere within this photograph. The image features a building with a fence in front of it, set against a backdrop of trees and hills. The scene appears to be from an earlier time period, possibly the early 20th century or late 19th century, based on the style of the building and the surrounding environment.

The absence of people suggests that the photographer may have intentionally captured the landscape or architecture without including any human subjects. Alternatively, it's possible that the individuals were not present at the time the photo was taken or were deliberately excluded from the frame.
