There are two people visible in this photograph. One person is on the left hand side of the image standing on a pier looking towards the water. They appear to be wearing dark clothing with light trousers and a darker shirt or jacket. It is impossible to determine if they are male or female.

The second person appears at the far end of the railway tracks in the middle distance, walking away from the camera with their back to us. Again, it is impossible to say whether this figure is male or female.
