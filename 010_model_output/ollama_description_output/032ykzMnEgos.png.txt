The photograph depicts a group of children gathered outside a building, dressed in white robes with white collars around their necks. The majority of the individuals appear to be young boys.

In the background, there are several adults visible. On the left side of the image, two men stand behind the children, while another man is positioned on the right side. Additionally, a woman can be seen standing at the far back, partially obscured by one of the boys in the front row.
