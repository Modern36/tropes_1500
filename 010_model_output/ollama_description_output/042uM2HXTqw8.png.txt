There are no people visible in this photograph. The image appears to be a black-and-white aerial view of a cityscape or town, with rows of white tents or canopies lining the streets. In the background, there are buildings and what looks like a large open area, possibly a park or plaza.

Since there are no individuals present in the image, it is not possible to determine their gender based on clothing or any other visual cues. Therefore, I must conclude that there are no people visible in this photograph.
