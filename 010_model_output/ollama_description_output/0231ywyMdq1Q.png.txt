There are five people in this photograph. There are three men standing in the foreground wearing long coats. The man on the left has his back turned away from the camera. Two other men stand with him, facing each other and talking. 

A fourth person stands out of focus behind a tree in the background on the right side of the image. Their features cannot be discerned because they are too far away.

The fifth person is sitting on a bench to the left of the three men but has been cut off at their waist by the edge of the photo, so we can only see their legs and part of their torso.
