The photograph depicts two men standing on a wooden platform, surrounded by construction materials and tools. The man on the left wears a dark coat with a white shirt underneath, while the man on the right is dressed in overalls and a hat. In the background, another person can be seen wearing a light-colored suit jacket.

Given their attire and hairstyles, which were typical of men during that era, it appears that all individuals visible in the image are male adults.
