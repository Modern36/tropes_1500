The photograph depicts three individuals, all of whom appear to be men. The man seated at a table is dressed in formal attire, consisting of a dark suit jacket and white shirt with an open collar. His hair is grayish-white and styled neatly.

Standing behind him are two other men, both wearing suits and ties. One has dark hair that is thinning on top, while the other has light-colored hair that is also thinning. All three individuals have fair skin tones.

In the background, there appears to be a window with curtains or blinds drawn, as well as some indistinct objects that may be furniture or decorations. However, these details are not clear due to the quality of the image.

Overall, based on their clothing and hairstyles, it is likely that all three individuals in the photograph are adult men from an earlier era, possibly during the mid-20th century.
