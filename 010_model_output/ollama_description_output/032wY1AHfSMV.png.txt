The photograph shows a man standing on the bow of a boat, with two women seated behind him. The man is wearing dark pants and a light-colored shirt, while the women are dressed in long skirts and blouses. One woman has her hair pulled back into a bun, while the other's hair is loose and flowing.

In the background, there appears to be another person sitting on the shore, but they are not clearly visible due to the distance and focus of the camera. This individual could potentially be male or female based on their attire alone; however, without more information or context regarding this figure's identity (e.g., whether it might represent someone known within historical records), we cannot make any definitive conclusions about gender from just visual cues provided here.

Overall, based solely on the clothing worn by each individual depicted in the image, one can infer that there are at least three people present: one male and two females.
