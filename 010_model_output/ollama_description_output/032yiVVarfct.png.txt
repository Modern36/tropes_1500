There are six people shown in this photograph; all appear to be men. The two foreground individuals are sitting at a table with their heads down, seemingly writing on documents laid out before them. They wear military-style uniforms and caps.

In the background, there are four additional men, standing behind the seated pair. Three of these men also wear military attire, while the fourth appears to be dressed in civilian clothing. The background individuals seem to be observing or supervising the activities of those at the table.
