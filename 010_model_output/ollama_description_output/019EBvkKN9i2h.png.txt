There are no individuals visible in this photograph. The image features a bridge spanning a river, with buildings and trees on either side. In the foreground, there is a large tree branch extending from the bottom-left corner towards the center of the image. On the right-hand side of the picture, partially hidden by the large tree branch, are two people. One appears to be an adult male wearing light-colored clothing, while the other seems to be a child dressed in dark attire. Both figures have their backs turned away from the camera as they face the river.

In the background, there is another person standing near the base of the bridge on the left side of the image. This individual also has their back facing the camera and appears to be wearing light-colored clothing. Additionally, a boat can be seen in the water beneath the bridge, but it does not contain any people. Overall, the photograph captures a serene scene with several individuals present, although they are mostly obscured or turned away from view.
