There does not appear to be any people visible in this photograph. The image appears to show a room with two tables covered with white tablecloths, each adorned with floral arrangements. In the background, there is a large window with curtains and a clock on the wall above it. On either side of the window are decorative panels or tapestries featuring a floral design. The floor is made of wood and has a rug in front of one of the tables.

The overall atmosphere suggests that this may be a formal event or gathering, possibly a wedding reception or banquet, given the presence of flowers and decorations. However, without more context or information about the occasion, it's difficult to say for certain what type of event this is.
