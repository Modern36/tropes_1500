There appear to be four individuals on the deck of a ship in this photograph. All four figures are wearing dark jackets with lighter-colored pants or trousers. Three wear hats, while one does not. Two people have white collars visible under their jackets. One person appears to be looking at something in his hand. The other three individuals seem to be facing towards the right side of the image. It is impossible to determine the gender, age, and race of these figures from this photograph alone.
