The photograph appears to be a portrait of one man in a suit.

He has short hair that is combed back from his forehead. He wears a dark suit with a white shirt and tie. A pocket handkerchief can be seen in the breast pocket of his jacket, but it cannot be determined what colour it is. 

The background appears to be light-coloured wall paper or a curtain. The man is the only person visible in the photograph.
