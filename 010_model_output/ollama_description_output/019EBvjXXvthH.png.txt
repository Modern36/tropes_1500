There appear to be two individuals in this photograph.

On the left-hand side of the image, there appears to be a male individual wearing dark attire with what seems to be a hat on his head as he stands outside a building. 

The second person can be seen on the right-hand side of the image walking towards the camera. It is difficult to determine if this person is a man or woman, but they appear to be carrying a bag in their left hand and wearing light-coloured clothing.

No children are visible in the photograph.
