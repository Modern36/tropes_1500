There appear to be seven people in this photograph. It is impossible to determine if they are men or women as there are no distinguishing features visible. 

On the left-hand side of the image, a person stands on a bridge, which spans across the snow-covered ground. This individual is positioned slightly above the other figures.

In the middle distance, a group of five people are gathered around what appears to be a horse-drawn carriage or sled. The individuals in this cluster are somewhat indistinct due to their distance from the camera and the low resolution of the image.

On the right-hand side of the picture, another person can be seen walking along a path that runs parallel to the bridge. This individual is also partially obscured by the surrounding environment.

It's worth noting that all the people in this photograph appear to be wearing winter clothing, including coats, hats, and gloves. This suggests that the image was taken during a cold weather season, possibly winter or early spring.
