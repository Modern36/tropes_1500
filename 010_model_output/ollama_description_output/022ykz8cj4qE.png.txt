The image presents a black-and-white photograph of two individuals dressed in costumes, with one person on the left wearing a dress and holding a sword, while the other person on the right is attired in what appears to be a military uniform or historical costume.

**Person on the Left:**

*   The person on the left is wearing a dark-colored dress that reaches down to their knees.
*   They have long hair that falls below their shoulders.
*   Their facial features are not clearly visible due to the low resolution of the image.
*   In their right hand, they hold a sword with an ornate hilt.

**Person on the Right:**

*   The person on the right is dressed in what seems to be a military uniform or historical costume.
*   They wear a hat and have short hair.
*   Like the first individual, their facial features are not discernible due to the image quality.
*   This person also holds a sword, but its details are less visible than the one held by the person on the left.

**Background:**

*   The background of the photograph is indistinct and does not provide any clear information about the setting or context in which the photo was taken.

Given the attire and props (swords), it suggests that these individuals might be participating in some form of historical reenactment, theatrical performance, or costume event. However, without more context, it's challenging to determine their gender based solely on their clothing choices within this specific image.
