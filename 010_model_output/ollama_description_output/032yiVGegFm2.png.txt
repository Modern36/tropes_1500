The photograph depicts a group of people gathered on a street at night, with some individuals standing in front of others. The crowd appears to be predominantly composed of adults, although it is challenging to discern any children due to the low resolution and poor lighting conditions.

In terms of gender distribution, it is difficult to make an accurate assessment as many faces are obscured or out of focus. However, based on clothing styles and hairstyles visible in the image, there seem to be more men than women present. Some individuals wear hats, which were common attire for both sexes during this era but may provide clues about their gender identity.

It's worth noting that some people in the background appear to be partially hidden by objects or other individuals, making it even harder to determine their sex. Additionally, the poor lighting and low resolution of the image further complicate efforts to identify specific details such as facial features or clothing items that could help distinguish between males and females.

Overall, while it is possible to make some educated guesses about the gender distribution within the crowd based on available visual cues, a definitive conclusion cannot be drawn due to the limitations imposed by the image's quality.
