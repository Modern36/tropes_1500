In this photograph, there appear to be four individuals. 

Three of the individuals can be seen from behind in a rowboat on the water. The individual sitting at the back of the boat, who appears to be rowing it, has dark hair and is wearing light-colored pants and a white short-sleeved shirt. It's difficult to determine the gender of this person due to the lack of distinguishing features visible in the photograph.

The other two individuals are seated on either side of the first individual. One of them is wearing a light-colored hat, while the other has dark hair that appears to be tied back with a ribbon or bandana. Unfortunately, it's challenging to discern any additional details about these individuals due to their position and distance from the camera.

In the bottom right corner of the photograph, partially obscured by darkness, there appears to be another individual standing on land, possibly holding onto a rope attached to the rowboat. This person is wearing dark clothing and has short hair that could be either light or dark in color. However, due to the poor lighting conditions and limited visibility, it's difficult to make out any further details about this individual.

Overall, while we can identify four people in the photograph, their facial features and other distinguishing characteristics are not clearly visible, making it challenging to determine specific details such as gender, age, or ethnicity.
