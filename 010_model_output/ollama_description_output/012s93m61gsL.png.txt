There do not appear to be any people visible in this photograph. The image seems to depict a storage room or warehouse filled with rolls of fabric, likely for use in textile manufacturing or tailoring. 

The absence of human figures suggests that the focus of the photograph is on the materials being stored rather than on individuals present at the scene.
