There are four men in this photograph.

There is one man standing on a dock wearing white pants and shoes with a dark jacket. He has his hands behind his back and he appears to be looking at something off camera.

Behind him, there are two other men wearing long-sleeved shirts and trousers, but their features cannot be made out clearly as they are mostly out of frame. 

There is also a man in the background who is partially hidden by the dock railing. His face cannot be seen, but he appears to be dressed similarly to the other three men.
