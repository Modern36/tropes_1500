The image depicts a black-and-white photograph of a train station scene, with several individuals present. 

In the foreground, there are approximately 15 people standing on the platform or near the tracks. The majority appear to be men, dressed in suits and hats, while one woman is visible wearing a long coat and hat. There are no children apparent in this section.

Moving further back into the image, another group of people can be seen waiting at a distance from the train. This group consists mainly of men, also attired in suits and hats. However, it's challenging to discern any women or children among them due to their position and attire.

On the left side of the photograph, near some buildings, additional figures are visible but out of focus. It remains unclear whether these individuals are men, women, or children as they are too distant and indistinct.

Lastly, in the background, more people can be observed standing on a bridge overlooking the train tracks. These individuals appear to be mostly men, again wearing suits and hats. No women or children are discernible within this group.

Overall, based on their clothing, the majority of the visible people seem to be men, with only one woman clearly identifiable in the foreground.
