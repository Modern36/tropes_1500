The photograph features a single person, a young girl standing in front of a bush with flowers. She is dressed in a light-colored dress adorned with dark polka dots and has short blonde hair. Her attire includes white socks and black Mary Jane shoes.

In the background, there are no other people visible. The focus of the image appears to be on the girl and her surroundings rather than any individuals in the distance or out-of-focus areas.
