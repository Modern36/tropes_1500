There are no people visible in this photograph. The image depicts a small, one-story building with a sloping roof and two chimneys, situated next to railroad tracks. The scene appears to be from an earlier time period, as evidenced by the old-fashioned signs and advertisements on display. In the background, there is a body of water that could be either a river or a lake.

The overall atmosphere suggests a quiet, rural setting with minimal human activity. The absence of people in the photograph adds to the sense of stillness and tranquility, allowing the viewer's focus to remain on the architectural details and natural surroundings.
