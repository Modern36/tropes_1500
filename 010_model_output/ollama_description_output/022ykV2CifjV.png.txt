There are no individuals visible in this photograph. The image depicts a narrow passageway with wooden walls on either side, possibly within a building or structure. The passageway stretches into the distance, but it does not appear to contain any people. 

The lighting suggests that there may be an opening at the end of the passageway, which could potentially allow individuals to enter or exit from that direction. However, as of now, there are no visible human figures in the image.
