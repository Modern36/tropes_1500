The photograph depicts a group of four men engaged in manual labor at an excavation site, with three individuals standing on the ground and one positioned higher up. The man on the left is dressed in dark attire, while the other three wear light-colored shirts and pants.

In the background, there appears to be another person or people, but due to the image's blurriness, it is challenging to discern their features or activities with certainty.
