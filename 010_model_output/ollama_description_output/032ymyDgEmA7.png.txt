The photograph shows a man on stage performing for an audience. He is wearing a white shirt with rolled-up sleeves, light-colored pants, and dark shoes.

To his right is a table covered in black fabric with a few objects placed upon it. Behind him, at the back of the stage, there are three additional people who appear to be musicians. One musician has a violin tucked under their chin, indicating that they are playing the instrument. The other two musicians have instruments that are not as clearly visible.

There is also an audience watching from chairs in front of the stage. These individuals are mostly out of focus, but it appears that there are both men and women present in the crowd.
