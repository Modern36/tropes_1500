This black and white photograph depicts a family of three seated in a room with wood paneling on the walls. The man on the left wears a dark suit jacket, while the woman on the right is dressed in a light-colored blouse and dark skirt. A young boy sits between them, wearing a light-colored shirt and shorts.

In the background, there are several objects visible, including a large piece of artwork or mirror hanging on the wall above the family's heads. To the left of this, another framed picture can be seen, although its details are not discernible due to the image quality.

The overall atmosphere of the photograph suggests that it was taken in the early 20th century, likely sometime between the 1920s and 1940s. The clothing styles and hairstyles of the individuals in the photo support this dating, as do the furnishings and decor visible in the background.
