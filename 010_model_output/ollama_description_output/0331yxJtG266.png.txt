The photograph depicts a scene from an office setting, likely taken in the early 20th century based on the attire and furniture visible. The image features several individuals engaged in various activities.

**Identifying Gender:**

Upon careful examination of the photograph, it is challenging to definitively identify the gender of most individuals due to the lack of clear facial features or distinctive clothing that would indicate their sex. However, some clues can be inferred:

*   **Men:** Some figures appear to wear suits and hats typical of men's fashion during this era, suggesting they are male.
*   **Women:** A few individuals might be wearing dresses or skirts, which were more common attire for women at the time, indicating they could be female. However, these distinctions are not always clear-cut.

**Conclusion:**

Given the limitations in discerning gender from the photograph alone and without explicit details about clothing styles that could definitively indicate male or female attire, it is prudent to refer to the individuals collectively as "people" rather than attempting to assign genders based on potentially ambiguous cues. This approach respects the uncertainty inherent in interpreting historical images with limited information available.
