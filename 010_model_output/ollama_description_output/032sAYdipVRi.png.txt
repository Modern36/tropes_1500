The photograph shows a group of 31 men standing on steps leading up to a building with large windows and doors. All the men are dressed in suits and ties, and most have pocket watches attached to their waistcoats by chains.

There are no women or children visible in this image. There are also no people who cannot be identified as male due to the way they are dressed.
