There are no visible people in this photograph. The image appears to be a scene from a play or performance, with six actors on stage.

The actors are all adults, but it is not possible to determine their gender due to the lack of clear facial features and clothing details. They are dressed in formal attire, which suggests that they may be playing characters from an upper-class background.

In the background, there are some props and set pieces that suggest a dining room or living room setting. There is a table with chairs, a sideboard, and a fireplace. The walls are adorned with paintings and other decorative items.

Overall, the image provides a glimpse into a moment in time from a theatrical performance, but it does not provide enough information to determine the gender of the actors involved.
