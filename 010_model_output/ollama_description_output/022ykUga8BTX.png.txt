The photograph shows a woman standing in the snow, holding a circular object with fabric attached to it. She is wearing a coat and hat, and appears to be smiling at the camera.

In the background, there are several people visible, although they are not clearly defined due to the distance and quality of the image. It is difficult to determine their gender or age based on the available information.

Overall, the photograph suggests that the woman in the foreground is the main subject, while the people in the background may be incidental or secondary figures.
