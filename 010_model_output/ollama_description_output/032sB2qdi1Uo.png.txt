The photograph depicts a young child sitting on an ornate wooden chair, dressed in light-colored clothing. The child's attire includes a short-sleeved shirt with buttons down the front and shorts or a skirt that falls just above the knee. Their shoes are dark-colored and have laces.

Behind the child stands another person, who appears to be an adult male due to his height and build relative to the seated individual. He is wearing light-colored pants and what seems to be a white shirt with long sleeves rolled up past the elbow. His left arm rests on the back of the chair, while his right hand holds onto something that cannot be clearly discerned in the image.

The background of the photo features a wall adorned with wallpaper or paint, adding context to the scene without drawing attention away from the subjects at its center.
