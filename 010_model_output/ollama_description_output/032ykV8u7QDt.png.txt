There are no people visible in this photograph. The image appears to be a black-and-white picture of an old wooden building with various tools leaning against it, including what looks like a pitchfork, a rake, and some other farming equipment. In the foreground, there is grass or hay on the ground. The overall atmosphere suggests a rural setting, possibly from the early 20th century given the style of the tools and the building's architecture.

Given that there are no individuals present in the image, it is not possible to determine their gender based on clothing or any other visual cues.
