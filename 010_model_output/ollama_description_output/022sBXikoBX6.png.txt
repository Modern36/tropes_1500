The photograph depicts a formal dinner party with 12 adults seated around a long table, dressed in attire typical of the early 20th century. The men wear suits and bow ties, while the women wear dresses. There are no children present in the image.

In the background, two individuals can be seen: one woman standing behind the table, likely serving food or drinks, and another person partially visible through an open doorway on the right side of the room. This individual is difficult to discern due to their position outside the main focus area and being slightly out of frame.
