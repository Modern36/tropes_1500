The photograph shows a single woman sitting on a couch facing the camera. She has short, curly hair that appears wavy and light-colored. The woman's face is blurred, but she seems to be smiling.

She is wearing an old-fashioned dress with long sleeves and a high neckline. Her hands are folded in her lap as she sits upright looking at the camera. A large collar covers her neck and shoulders. It has two white buttons on either side of it. There appears to be another button down the front near her chest area.

The background is out of focus but seems to show an old-fashioned room with a dark-colored wall. It's hard to tell if there are any other people in this image because everything behind the woman is blurry and indistinct.
