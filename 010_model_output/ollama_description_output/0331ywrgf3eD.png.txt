There do not appear to be any people visible in this photograph. The image depicts a large house with a balcony on the left side, surrounded by trees and bushes. The house has multiple windows and a chimney, suggesting it may have been used as a residence or possibly an inn or hotel given its size. In the foreground, there are several trees and bushes that partially obscure the view of the house. 

There is no indication of any individuals in the image, either in the foreground, mid-ground, or background. The focus of the photograph appears to be solely on capturing the exterior features of the house and its surroundings rather than including people within the scene.

Given the absence of any visible human figures, it is not possible to determine the gender identity of anyone present based on clothing or other visual cues since there are no individuals depicted in the image.
