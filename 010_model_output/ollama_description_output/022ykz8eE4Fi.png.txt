This photograph appears to show a child sitting on an ornate chair with a striped patterned cushion or upholstery. The child has short blonde hair and is wearing a dark-coloured woollen coat, white shirt and black shoes. The child's attire suggests that the image was taken in the early 20th century.

The child is smiling at the camera, suggesting that they are comfortable around people and may be used to having their photograph taken. Their posture also suggests that they have been coached on how to sit for a portrait.
