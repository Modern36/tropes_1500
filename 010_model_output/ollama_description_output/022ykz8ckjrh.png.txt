There do not appear to be any people in this photograph. 

The image appears to show a plain gray wall with a shadow cast across it, likely from an unseen object or person positioned outside the frame of the photograph. The shadow is dark and indistinct, making it difficult to discern any features or details about its source.

In the background, there are no visible objects or people that can be clearly identified as such. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a dimly lit room or setting, with the gray wall serving as a neutral backdrop for the shadowy figure in the foreground.
