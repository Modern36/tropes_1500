There do not appear to be any people visible in this photograph. The image shows a chair against a wall covered with wallpaper featuring a repeating pattern of vertical stripes. The wallpaper has a light-colored background and features darker-colored designs, including what appears to be a floral motif.

The overall atmosphere of the image suggests that it may have been taken indoors, possibly in a home or office setting. However, without more context or information about the location where the photo was taken, it is difficult to say for certain whether the individuals depicted are men, women, or children.
