The photograph shows a man standing on skis with ski poles in each hand, wearing a hat, goggles, gloves, and a scarf around his neck. He is dressed in a thick coat and pants, which are typical attire for cold weather sports like skiing.

Behind the main subject, there appears to be another person partially obscured by him. This individual's face is not visible due to being covered by the man's body. However, based on their clothing, it seems they might also be engaged in winter activities or at least dressed appropriately for the season.

In the background, several other figures can be seen, although they are somewhat out of focus and difficult to make out clearly. These individuals seem to be standing near what could be a building or structure, possibly related to the ski resort or facility where the photo was taken. Some of them may also be wearing winter clothing similar to that of the main subjects.

Overall, while it's challenging to determine specific details about gender for all figures due to distance and focus issues, it appears there are at least two people directly involved in skiing (the man in the foreground and possibly someone behind him) and several others observing or participating indirectly in the background.
