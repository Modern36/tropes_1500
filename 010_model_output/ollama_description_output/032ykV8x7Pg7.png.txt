There do not appear to be any people visible in this picture. The photograph appears to show a landscape with grassy fields or meadows and trees. There are no buildings or structures that might house people, nor are there any roads, paths or other features of human activity.

It is important to note that the presence of people cannot always be determined solely by looking at an image. People may be present but not visible due to factors such as distance, obstruction by objects, low light levels, poor image quality, or intentional exclusion from the frame.
