There do not appear to be any people visible in this picture. There appears to be a horse and carriage in the center of the image, but there does not seem to be anyone riding it. The photograph was taken at an angle that would have captured people who were walking along the road or standing on the sidewalk next to the road, so if anyone was present they are likely hidden by objects or out of frame.

There is a flagpole near the right side of the image but there does not appear to be a person raising or lowering the flag. There also appears to be a path at the end of the road that leads to some buildings, and it's possible that people could be visible if they were walking along this path, but none are present.

There do not appear to be any partially hidden objects or out-of-focus areas in the image where people might be located. Overall, based on my analysis, there don't seem to be any human figures in the photograph.
