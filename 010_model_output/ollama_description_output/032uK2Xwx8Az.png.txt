The photograph you provided shows a large group of young women standing on stone steps outside a church.

There are approximately 100 girls visible in the image. Most of them wear white dresses with dark sashes, and many have flowers pinned to their chests or in their hair. The majority appear to be between the ages of 10 and 18 years old.

Behind the girls, there is an older woman standing on a balcony overlooking them. She wears a long dress and may possibly be holding something in her hands. Behind her, through the arched window, you can see the branches of trees. To the left of this figure, behind the group of girls, there are two men visible. They wear formal suits with hats.

There appear to be no children under 10 years old or people over 50 years old in this image. The photograph has been taken from a slight distance above the subjects and was likely captured sometime during the early part of the twentieth century, judging by their clothing styles.
