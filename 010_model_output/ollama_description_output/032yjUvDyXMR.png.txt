The photograph shows a group of men working on an icy ship, with several individuals visible in various poses and locations.

In the foreground, there are at least five men engaged in different activities. One man is standing on the deck, holding onto the rigging for support as he gazes out into the distance. Another man is kneeling down near the bow of the ship, possibly performing some kind of maintenance task. A third man can be seen climbing up a rope ladder attached to the side of the hull.

In addition to these men, there are several others visible in the background or partially obscured by objects within the image. For example, one person appears to be standing at the helm of the ship, steering it through the icy waters. Another individual is seen walking along the deck, carrying a large bundle of supplies or equipment.

Overall, based on their clothing and hairstyles, all of the people depicted in this photograph appear to be adult males. They are dressed in warm winter attire suitable for working outdoors in cold conditions, including coats, hats, gloves, and boots. Their facial expressions suggest that they are focused on their tasks and may be experiencing some level of discomfort due to the harsh weather conditions.

It's worth noting that while it is possible to make educated guesses about the gender of individuals based on their appearance, without more information or context, it cannot be definitively determined whether any specific person in this photograph is male or female. However, given the historical period and cultural norms depicted in the image, it seems likely that most if not all of the people shown are indeed men.
