There do not appear to be any people visible in this image. The photograph depicts what appears to be a ship under construction or repair on a slipway, with scaffolding surrounding it. Various workmen, some wearing hats and jackets, are engaged in different activities such as hammering and carrying wooden planks. In the background, there is a body of water with several boats and ships moored along the shore, including a large cargo ship being loaded or unloaded by cranes and pulleys. The overall atmosphere suggests a busy industrial scene during the day.
