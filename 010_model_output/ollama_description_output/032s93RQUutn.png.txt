There do not appear to be any humans visible within this picture. The image shows a dead animal lying on a tablecloth. There appears to be some flowers or foliage placed on top of it, and some other items behind it that are obscured from view. It is not clear what type of animal this is, but it could be a piglet or lamb based on its size and shape.

The background of the image is out of focus, so it's difficult to make out any details about the setting where the photo was taken. However, there appears to be some kind of wall or surface behind the tablecloth that may provide context for understanding what this picture represents.
