There are no people visible in this photograph.

The image appears to be a vintage wedding photo of a bride and groom. The bride is wearing a white dress with a veil, while the groom is dressed in a black tuxedo. They are standing together, holding hands, and looking at each other. The background of the photo is blurred, but it appears to be a formal setting, possibly a church or a grand hall.

Unfortunately, there are no people visible in this photograph beyond the bride and groom.
