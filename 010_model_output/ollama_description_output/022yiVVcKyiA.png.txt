The photograph depicts a group of people gathered around a boat on the shore. The individuals are dressed in attire typical of the early 20th century, with men wearing hats and jackets, while women wear long dresses and headscarves. Children are also present, playing near the water's edge.

In the background, several buildings can be seen, including what appears to be a small cottage or shack. A few trees are scattered throughout the area, providing shade for the people gathered nearby. The overall atmosphere of the photograph suggests a sense of community and leisure, as the individuals seem to be enjoying each other's company in a peaceful setting.

Given the time period and cultural context depicted in the image, it is likely that the majority of the individuals are men, with some women and children also present. However, without more information or specific details about the individuals' clothing or activities, it is difficult to make any definitive conclusions regarding their gender identity. Therefore, it would be most appropriate to refer to them as "people" rather than making assumptions based on limited visual cues.

It's worth noting that the photograph may have been taken during a time when societal norms and expectations around gender roles were more rigidly defined than they are today. As such, any interpretations of gender identity should take into account these historical context and avoid imposing modern-day assumptions onto individuals from past eras.
