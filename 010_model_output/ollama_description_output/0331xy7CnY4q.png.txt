There appear to be two people standing on a platform at a station. It is difficult to say with any certainty whether they are male or female as their features and clothing are not clearly visible. They seem to be wearing coats or jackets, but it is impossible to make out other details of their outfits. 

One person stands just in front of the main entrance door and appears to be looking towards the right side of the image. The second person is standing further back near a window. They appear to be looking straight ahead.
