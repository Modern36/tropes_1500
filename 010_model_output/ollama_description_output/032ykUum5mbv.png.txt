There is a man walking on the sidewalk wearing dark pants and shoes with a white shirt and light-colored jacket. He appears to be in his mid-thirties or forties and has short hair. In the background, there are two people standing near the building's entrance, but they are not clearly visible due to the distance and lack of focus. One person is wearing a dark jacket and pants, while the other is dressed in lighter-colored clothing. It is difficult to determine their ages or genders based on the available information.

In addition to these individuals, there may be others present in the scene who are not immediately apparent due to the angle of the photograph or the presence of obstacles that block our view. For example, someone could be standing just out of frame behind one of the trees or buildings visible in the background. Without more context or a wider-angle shot, it is impossible to say for certain whether anyone else is present in this scene beyond what we can see directly in front of us.
