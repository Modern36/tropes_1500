The photograph appears to depict a woman who could have been photographed during the early 20th century. She has short hair styled into an updo or bob with a curled fringe, which was typical for women's hairstyles in the 1920s and 1930s. Her outfit consists of a dark dress adorned with intricate lace detailing on the front, along with a string of pearls around her neck. A brooch is pinned to her left shoulder.

There are no other individuals visible in this image apart from the woman in focus.
