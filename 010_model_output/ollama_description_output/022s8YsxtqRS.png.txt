There are no people visible in this photograph. The scene appears to be a serene landscape with a dirt road or path leading into the distance, flanked by trees and possibly a fence on one side. In the background, there's a glimpse of what could be a house or building, but it's too distant to discern any details. Given the absence of individuals in the image, it's not possible to determine gender or age based on clothing since no figures are present.
