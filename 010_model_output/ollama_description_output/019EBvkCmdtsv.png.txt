The photograph depicts a snowy street scene with several individuals present. In the foreground, two men are visible: one standing on the right side of the image wearing a long coat and hat, while another man walks along the left side of the road carrying what appears to be a large bundle or package.

In the background, there are additional people walking down the street, although they are not clearly defined due to being out of focus. The individuals in the background appear to be adults rather than children, but it is difficult to determine their gender with certainty due to the lack of detail and the fact that many are wearing heavy winter clothing.

Overall, the photograph suggests a busy urban scene during a snowy day, with multiple people going about their daily activities despite the inclement weather.
