The photograph depicts a scene with several individuals, but it is challenging to discern their gender due to the low resolution and lack of clear details. In the foreground, there appears to be one person standing near an object that resembles a wheelbarrow or cart. The individual's attire suggests they might be male, wearing dark clothing and possibly a hat.

In the background, another figure can be seen entering a building through a doorway. This person is also difficult to identify by gender due to the distance and poor image quality. They seem to be dressed in lighter-colored clothing compared to the first individual.

To provide a detailed description of these people while avoiding assumptions about their genders:

*   The person in the foreground appears to have dark hair and is wearing dark-colored attire, which includes pants and what looks like a long-sleeved shirt under another layer. Their facial features are indistinct due to the image quality.
*   The individual entering the building has lighter hair and wears lighter-toned clothing that could include a dress or skirt, though this is speculative given the resolution.

Given the limitations of the photograph's clarity and detail, it is most appropriate to refer to these individuals as "people" without making specific gender assignments.
