The photograph shows two people walking towards a building with a bicycle rack outside. The person on the left appears to be male, wearing dark pants and a light-colored shirt or jacket. He has short hair and is carrying something in his right hand that may be a bag or briefcase.

The person on the right is partially obscured by another object, making it difficult to determine their gender or any other characteristics. They appear to be wearing lighter-colored clothing than the man.

In the background, there are several objects visible, including what appears to be a car parked near the building and some trees or bushes behind it. The sky above is overcast, suggesting that the photo was taken on a cloudy day.

Overall, based on the limited information available from this photograph, I would describe the people as follows:

* Person 1 (on the left): Male, wearing dark pants and light-colored shirt/jacket, carrying an object in his right hand.
* Person 2 (on the right): Unknown gender due to partial obstruction, wearing lighter-colored clothing.

It's worth noting that without more context or information about the photograph, it's difficult to provide a more detailed description of the people or their activities.
