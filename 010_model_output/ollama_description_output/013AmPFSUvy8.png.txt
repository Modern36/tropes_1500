The photograph depicts a group of men standing in formation, with one man sitting on a bicycle. The men are dressed in military uniforms and appear to be engaged in some sort of training or exercise.

In the background, there is a large building that appears to be a barracks or other military facility. There are also several trees and other objects visible in the distance, but they are not clearly defined due to the low resolution of the image.

Overall, the scene suggests that the men are part of a military unit or organization, and are participating in some kind of training or activity.
