There are no people visible in the photograph. The image appears to be a black-and-white picture of an old-fashioned sideboard or cabinet, with intricate carvings on the front and ornate handles. The background is dark and indistinct, but it seems to be a room with a high ceiling and possibly some furniture or decorations.

Since there are no people in the photograph, I cannot provide any information about their gender, age, clothing, or other characteristics. If you have any further questions or would like me to analyze another image, please let me know.
