There are no people visible in this photograph. The image features a wooden door with a diamond-shaped pattern, set within a stone wall. The door is adorned with a large iron knocker in the shape of a lion's head and a keyhole below it. A small window above the door allows natural light to enter the room or hallway beyond.

The absence of any individuals in the image makes it impossible to identify their gender based on clothing, facial features, or other distinguishing characteristics.
