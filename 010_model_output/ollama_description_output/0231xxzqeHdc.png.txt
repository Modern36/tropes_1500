There do not appear to be any people visible in this photograph. The image depicts a steam locomotive on train tracks with a single carriage attached. There appears to be no one operating the train or standing next to it. 

The background of the image shows trees, bushes and other foliage that is out of focus. No people are visible in the background of the image.

It should also be noted that this photograph was taken from a distance away from the locomotive so any people present may not have been captured by the camera.
