The photograph depicts a woman seated in a chair with two children standing behind her. The woman wears a floral dress and has short hair, while the child on the left appears to be a boy wearing a sailor suit, and the child on the right is a girl dressed in a dark-colored dress.

In the background, there are no other people visible. However, it's worth noting that the photograph may have been taken indoors or outdoors, but without additional context, it's difficult to determine the exact location.
