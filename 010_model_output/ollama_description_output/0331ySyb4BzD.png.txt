The photograph features four individuals gathered around a window, with three of them standing close together and one person positioned slightly behind the others. The person on the left appears to be a woman wearing a long skirt or dress, while the two people in front of her are too short to see clearly but seem to be children based on their height relative to the other individuals in the image.

In terms of facial features, only the face of the man on the far right is visible. He has dark hair and is looking directly at the camera with a neutral expression. The woman's face is partially obscured by her hat, making it difficult to discern any distinct facial characteristics. The faces of the two children are not visible due to their height.

Overall, based on the clothing and hairstyles depicted in the photograph, it appears that the image was taken during the early 20th century. However, without more context or information about the specific time period or location where the photo was taken, it is impossible to determine an exact date range for when the picture was captured.
