The image is a black-and-white photograph of a group of people posing for the camera. The majority of the individuals in the photo are dressed as cooks or chefs, wearing white aprons and hats. They appear to be standing in front of a building with a sign that reads "Kochschule" (Cooking School) above them.

Upon closer inspection, it seems that all the people depicted in this historical photograph are adults. There are no visible children present in the image. As for their gender, based on traditional clothing styles and hairstyles during the time period when the photo was taken, most of these individuals can be identified as men. However, there may also be some women among them who wore shorter haircuts or less feminine attire than what would have been typical at that time.

It's important to note that without additional context or information about the specific historical event or setting captured in this photograph, it's challenging to make definitive conclusions regarding the gender identity of each individual depicted. Nevertheless, based on visual cues such as clothing and hairstyles, it appears that the majority of those shown are men, while a smaller number could potentially be women who adopted more masculine styles during an era when gender roles were less fluid than they are today.
