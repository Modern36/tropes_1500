The photograph features a single individual, likely an adult woman with short hair styled in waves. She wears a dark-colored dress adorned with a brooch at her neck and has on high heels. The background of the image appears to be a studio setting.

In terms of gender identification based on attire, during this time period (likely early 20th century), women's fashion typically included dresses that fell below the knee or longer, often accompanied by hats or headpieces like the one worn by the subject in the photograph. Men's clothing usually consisted of suits and ties for formal occasions or button-down shirts with trousers for more casual events.

Given these cultural norms surrounding dress during that era, it is reasonable to conclude that the person depicted in the photograph is indeed a woman based on her attire alone. However, without additional context such as facial features or other distinguishing characteristics, one cannot definitively determine gender solely from clothing choices within this specific historical period.
