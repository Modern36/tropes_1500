The photograph depicts a group of four individuals dressed in costumes, with three of them standing together and one person partially visible on the right side. The first person from the left is wearing a checkered apron over a white dress, suggesting they may be portraying a domestic worker or servant. Their attire does not provide clear indication of their gender.

The second person appears to be dressed as a bride, wearing a white wedding dress and veil. This costume implies that this individual is likely female, given the traditional association of brides with women.

The third person is attired in dark clothing, which could indicate either male or female attire without further context. However, based on historical norms where men often wore darker colors for formal occasions, it's possible to infer that this person might be male, though it remains speculative without more information.

On the far right, only a portion of another individual is visible, making gender determination impossible due to lack of detail.

In summary, while we can make educated guesses about genders based on attire and historical context, definitive conclusions are challenging due to partial visibility or ambiguous costumes. Therefore, referring to these individuals as "people" would be appropriate, acknowledging the uncertainty in gender identification from this photograph alone.
