The photograph depicts a black-and-white scene of a train station with several individuals present. 

In the foreground, there are no people visible.

Behind the train, on the left side of the image, two men stand near the tracks. One man wears a long coat and hat, while the other is dressed in a lighter-colored shirt and darker pants. Both appear to be adults.

To the right of these men, another person stands behind them but is partially obscured by their presence. This individual's features are not discernible due to being out of focus and hidden from view.

On the far left side of the image, near the edge of the frame, a woman can be seen walking towards the camera. She is wearing a long dress and has her hair styled in an updo. Her facial expression cannot be determined due to the distance and quality of the photograph.

In the background, there are several other people visible but they are too far away or out of focus to make out any distinguishing features. 

Overall, based on their clothing and hairstyles, it appears that all the individuals in the photograph are adults.
