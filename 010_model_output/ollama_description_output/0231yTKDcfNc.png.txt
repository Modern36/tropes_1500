The image depicts a black-and-white photograph of an old train station with a sign reading "OVERGANG" on it. The scene features several individuals, including:

* A person in dark attire standing near the front of the building
* Two people walking away from the camera towards the left side of the image
* A group of three people gathered around what appears to be a luggage cart or trolley

In the background, there are trees and other buildings visible through the windows of the train station. The overall atmosphere suggests a busy and active scene with multiple individuals present.

Based on their clothing and hairstyles, it is difficult to determine the gender of most of these people. However, one person in the foreground appears to be wearing a hat and coat that may indicate they are male. Another person in the background has long hair that could suggest they are female. Without more information or context, it is impossible to make any definitive conclusions about the genders of the individuals depicted in this photograph.

It's worth noting that the image quality is not high enough to discern many details about the people beyond their general presence and some basic characteristics such as clothing and hairstyles.
