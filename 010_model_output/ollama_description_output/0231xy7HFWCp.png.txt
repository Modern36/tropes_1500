There do not appear to be any people visible anywhere in this image. The photograph depicts a small town or village with buildings, roads, and trees, but no individuals are present. It's possible that the photographer intentionally avoided capturing people in the shot or that they were simply not there at the time of taking the picture. Without further context or information about the location and date of the photo, it's difficult to say for certain why there are no people visible.
