The photograph features a woman seated in a chair, dressed in a long-sleeved dress with a high neckline and a dark skirt. Her hair is styled in an updo, and she wears a necklace around her neck. The woman's attire suggests that the photo was taken during the early 20th century.

In the background, there are no other people visible. However, it is possible that some individuals may be partially hidden or out of focus behind the woman or objects within the scene. Without additional context or information about the photograph, it is challenging to provide more specific details regarding the presence of men, women, or children beyond what can be observed directly from the image.

Given the limited visibility and potential for partial concealment, I must rely on my current capabilities to analyze visual data without making assumptions about unseen elements. Therefore, based solely on the visible content of the photograph, I can confirm the presence of one woman but cannot definitively determine if there are any other individuals present who may not be fully visible or discernible within the image.
