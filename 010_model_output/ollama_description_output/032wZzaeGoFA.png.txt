There does not appear to be any people visible in this image. The photograph shows a rural house or cabin with trees and bushes surrounding it. The building has a sloping roof and appears to be made of wood. In front of the house, there are several trees and bushes, as well as what appears to be a garden or yard area. However, despite careful examination, no individuals can be seen in the image.

It's worth noting that the quality of the photograph is not high enough to make out any details beyond the general features of the scene. The image may have been taken at a distance or with a low-resolution camera, which could explain why no people are visible. Additionally, it's possible that the photographer intentionally avoided including people in the shot, focusing instead on capturing the natural beauty of the surroundings.
