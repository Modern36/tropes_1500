The image depicts a group of people standing in front of a stone wall, with some individuals partially obscured by others or objects. The majority of the people appear to be adults, although it is challenging to determine their exact ages due to the black-and-white photograph and the fact that they are not the primary focus.

In the foreground, there are several men wearing suits and hats, which were common attire for men during the time period depicted in the image. Some women can also be seen, dressed in long coats and dresses, typical of female fashion from the same era. However, it is difficult to discern any children among the crowd.

Behind the main group, additional people are visible, including both men and women. They seem to be standing in a line or waiting for something, possibly an event or a ceremony. The atmosphere appears formal, with many individuals dressed in their Sunday best.

Overall, while it is not possible to determine the exact number of children present, based on the clothing and hairstyles, it seems unlikely that there are any young children in the image. The majority of the people appear to be adults, likely gathered for a specific occasion or event.
