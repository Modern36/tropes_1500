The photograph shows a baby wearing no clothes except for shoes. The child's gender cannot be determined from this image because the child appears too young to determine its sex and there are no visible clues such as hair length or style, facial features, or clothing that would indicate whether it is male or female.

There do not appear to be any other people in the photograph.
