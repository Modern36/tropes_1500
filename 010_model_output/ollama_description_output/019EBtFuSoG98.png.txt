The photograph shows a black-and-white picture of a bride and groom on their wedding day. The woman wears a long, white dress with short sleeves and has her hair styled up. She holds a bouquet of flowers in front of her waist.

To the right of the bride stands the man, wearing a dark suit and tie. He has his left hand in his pocket. Both individuals are looking directly at the camera.

In the background, there appears to be a wall or backdrop behind them, but it is not clear due to the low resolution of the image. There do not appear to be any other people visible in the photograph beyond the bride and groom.
