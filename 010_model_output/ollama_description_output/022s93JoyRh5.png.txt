There are no people visible in this photograph. The image appears to be a black-and-white picture of a construction site or excavation area, with various objects and materials scattered throughout. In the foreground, there is a large pile of dirt or debris, surrounded by wooden planks and other building materials. A shovel leans against a wall on the right side of the frame.

In the background, a few buildings can be seen, including what appears to be a house or apartment complex with multiple stories. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests that it was taken during a time of urban development or renovation, possibly in the early 20th century given the style of the buildings and the lack of modern technology visible in the scene.

Given the absence of any people in the photograph, it is impossible to describe their characteristics such as gender, age, clothing, facial features, body language, or interaction with each other. The focus of the image seems to be on capturing the physical environment rather than depicting individuals within it.
