There appear to be two individuals standing next to one of the buses, with another person possibly visible in the distance behind them. Due to the low resolution of the photograph, it is not possible to determine whether these are men or women. However, they do seem to be adults rather than children.

The individual on the left is dressed in dark clothing and appears to have their head slightly tilted upwards, giving the impression that they may be looking towards someone or something out of frame. The person next to them is also wearing dark attire but seems more focused on the bus, possibly engaged in conversation with someone inside or examining its exterior.

In the background, there are some indistinct shapes that could potentially represent people, though it's difficult to say for certain without clearer imagery. These figures appear distant and blurry, making identification challenging.
