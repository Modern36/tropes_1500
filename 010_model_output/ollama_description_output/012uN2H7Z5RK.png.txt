The photograph shows a man standing on the deck of a ship. He is wearing dark pants and a white hat with a thin black band around it, as well as a white collar peeking out from under his jacket. The man has short hair.

Behind him, there are several other men who appear to be sailors or crew members. They are all wearing similar uniforms, consisting of light-colored shirts and dark pants. Some of them have hats on their heads, while others do not. In the background, there is a large structure that appears to be part of the ship's superstructure. It has several windows and doors, and what looks like a ladder leading up to it.

Overall, the scene suggests that the men are engaged in some kind of activity related to the operation or maintenance of the ship.
