The photograph shows a man in a suit and tie, with short hair slicked back. He is wearing a light-colored shirt and dark pants, which appear to be formal attire for the time period.

There are no other people visible in the image, as it appears to be a portrait of this individual alone. The background is plain and does not provide any additional context or clues about the subject's identity or surroundings.

Overall, based on the clothing and hairstyle, it can be inferred that the person in the photograph is likely a man from an earlier era, possibly during the mid-20th century.
