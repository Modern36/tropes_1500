The photograph depicts a young girl with braided hair, wearing a dark dress and apron, standing beside a chair adorned with floral patterns. She holds a book in her left hand, while her right arm rests on the back of the chair.

In the background, there are no other people visible in the image. The overall atmosphere suggests that this is a formal portrait taken during the late 19th or early 20th century.
