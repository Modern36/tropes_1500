The image is a black-and-white photograph of three individuals, including one adult woman and two children. 

In the foreground, there is an adult woman sitting on a chair with her legs crossed. She has short hair and is wearing a dark dress or skirt and blouse. Her facial features are not clearly visible due to the low resolution of the image.

Behind the woman, there appears to be another person standing in the doorway. This individual's face is also not discernible, but they seem to be wearing a light-colored shirt and pants. 

In the background, there are several other people who can be seen through the open door. These individuals appear to be men, as evidenced by their attire, which includes suits and hats. They seem to be engaged in some sort of activity, possibly a meeting or gathering.

Overall, based on the clothing worn by the individuals in the photograph, it appears that this image was taken during the early 20th century, likely sometime between 1900 and 1940.
