There are no people visible in this photograph. The scene appears to depict a building under construction or demolition, with piles of debris and materials scattered around the area. In the foreground, there is a pile of rubble and what looks like a large piece of machinery, possibly a crane or excavator. Behind the machinery, there is a row of buildings that appear to be residential in nature, although they are not clearly visible due to the distance and angle of the shot.

In the background, there are several other buildings and structures that can be seen through the haze, but none of them appear to have any people present. Overall, the image suggests a scene of urban development or renovation, with no human activity visible at all.
