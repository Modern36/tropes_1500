The image is a black-and-white photograph of an airplane with two men standing beside it. The plane has the letters "G-A" visible on its side, but the rest of the registration number is not legible.

One man is wearing a suit and hat, while the other is dressed in casual attire. They are both facing away from the camera, looking at something off to their right. In front of them is a cart with luggage stacked on it.

In the background, there appears to be another person or object that is partially obscured by the plane's wing. However, due to the poor quality of the image and the fact that this figure is out of focus, it is difficult to determine whether they are male, female, or non-binary.

Overall, based on the clothing worn by the two men in the foreground, it can be inferred that they are likely male. However, without more information or a clearer view of the background figure, it is impossible to say for certain whether they identify as male, female, or non-binary.
