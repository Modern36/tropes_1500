There appears to be a woman sitting on a couch with two cats on her lap. The woman has short curly hair and wears dark clothes with a white collar. She sits on a couch covered in a patterned blanket, which matches her dress's color palette. 

In the background of the image, there is nothing but wall with a few pictures hanging up on it. There are also two windows with curtains to the left side of the room that has two chairs and a small table between them. The room appears to be an older home from the 1940s or earlier based off its decor and furniture.
