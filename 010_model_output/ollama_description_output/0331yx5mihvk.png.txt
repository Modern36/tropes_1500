There are two people visible on this photograph, standing near a train engine. They appear to both be men, with one wearing what looks like a suit and hat and the other a more casual outfit. Both have dark hair. The man in the suit is looking directly at the camera while the other man appears to be turned away from it. 

The two men are located on the left-hand side of the photo, standing near the front of the train engine. They are not the main focus of the image but are included as part of a wider historical photograph.
