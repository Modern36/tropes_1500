There appear to be three people in this black-and-white photograph. All three seem to be wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants. The two individuals on the right-hand side near what appears to be railroad tracks are standing close together, but it's impossible to tell whether they are men or women from their clothing alone. 

The third person is on the left-hand side of the photograph and is walking away from the camera, which also makes it difficult to determine if this is a man or woman.

These three figures seem to be the only individuals in the image because there appear to be no other human beings visible in the foreground or background that are either out of focus or partially hidden by objects.
