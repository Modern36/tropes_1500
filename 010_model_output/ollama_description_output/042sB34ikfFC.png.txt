The image is a black-and-white photograph of two young girls posing for a portrait.

The girl on the left has short hair and wears a dark-colored dress with a white collar and cuffs, paired with dark stockings and shoes. She stands behind her sister, who sits in a wooden chair adorned with intricate carvings. The seated girl also has short hair and is dressed in a similar outfit, consisting of a dark dress, white collar and cuffs, dark stockings, and shoes.

Both girls are looking directly at the camera with neutral expressions. In their hands, they hold gloves, which were likely worn for the photo shoot but removed during the portrait. The background features a plain wall or backdrop, allowing the focus to remain on the subjects.
