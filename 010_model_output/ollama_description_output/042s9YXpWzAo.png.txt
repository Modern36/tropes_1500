In this black-and-white photograph, two individuals can be seen in the distance on the left-hand side of the image, standing on a hill. The person on the right appears to be wearing dark trousers and a lighter-colored shirt, while the other individual's attire cannot be discerned due to being out of focus.

The background of the picture features a grassy field with trees visible behind it. In the foreground, there is a house engulfed in flames, with smoke billowing into the air. The overall atmosphere suggests that the scene depicts a fire or some other catastrophic event.
