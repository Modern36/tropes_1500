The photograph depicts a group of approximately 20 individuals, all of whom appear to be men, seated on the ground in a grassy field. They are dressed in military attire and caps, with some wearing jackets or coats. The men are arranged in three rows, with those in the back row standing and those in the front two rows sitting down.

In the background, there is a large tree visible behind the group of men. Additionally, several other individuals can be seen walking towards the camera from the right side of the image. These people appear to be dressed in civilian clothing and are not part of the main group of men.
