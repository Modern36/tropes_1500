There do not appear to be any people visible in this image.

The image is a black-and-white photograph of an empty room with white walls and a wooden floor. The room appears to be a living room or parlor, with a large window on the left side of the image that lets in natural light. There is a door on the right side of the image that leads out of the room.

In the center of the room, there is a table with two chairs pushed up against it. The table has a vase of flowers on it, and there are some books and papers scattered across its surface. On the wall above the table, there is a large mirror hanging from a hook.

Overall, the image suggests that this is a quiet, peaceful space where someone might sit and read or work on their computer.
