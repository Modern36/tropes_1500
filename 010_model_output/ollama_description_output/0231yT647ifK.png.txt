There appears to be 1 person visible in this photo, a man dressed in white standing on the platform next to the train station building. He could potentially be an employee or attendant at the station, given his crisp attire and the fact that he's standing alone on the platform.

There are other people in the background of this image, however they are not visible enough to determine their clothing or gender. There is a group of approximately 5-6 individuals gathered near the edge of the photo, but unfortunately it is impossible to make out any details about them due to the distance and lack of resolution.
