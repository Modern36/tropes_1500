The photograph appears to show a group of men standing around what could possibly be a building under construction. The image is black and white and has a grainy texture which makes it difficult to identify many details.

There are approximately 20 people in the photograph, all of whom appear to be wearing long coats or trench coats with hats on their heads. None of them are wearing anything that would suggest they are women or children. They stand around what appears to be some sort of construction site, possibly a building under renovation. 

The image is too grainy and dark to make out many other details about the people's appearances. There do not appear to be any other people in the background or foreground who could not be seen clearly due to being partially obscured by objects or out of focus.
