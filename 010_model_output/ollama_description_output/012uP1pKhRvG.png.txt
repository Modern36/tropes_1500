The photograph depicts a single individual, who appears to be a man dressed in military attire. He is wearing a formal uniform with epaulets on his shoulders and medals pinned to his chest. The man's facial expression suggests that he may be of middle age or older.

In the background, there are no other people visible in the image. However, it is worth noting that the photograph has been cropped at the top, which means that any additional individuals who may have been present above the frame cannot be seen.

Overall, based on the available information, I would conclude that this photograph features only one person: an older man dressed in military uniform.
