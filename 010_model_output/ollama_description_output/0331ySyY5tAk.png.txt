The photograph shows a black-and-white image of a train track with a trolley car on it. The trolley car is positioned near a building, but there are no people visible in the picture.

**Key Features:**

*   A trolley car is present on the train tracks.
*   There is a building nearby, but its details are not clear due to the black-and-white nature of the image and the distance from which it was taken.
*   No individuals can be seen in the foreground or background of the photograph.

**Conclusion:**

Given the absence of any visible people in the image, it is impossible to determine their gender based on clothing or other visual cues. Therefore, if we were to refer to someone in this context, they would simply be described as "people" without specifying gender.
