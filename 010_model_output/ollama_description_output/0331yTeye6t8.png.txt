There are no people visible in this photograph. The image depicts a train car that has been damaged, possibly due to an accident or collision, with debris scattered around it. In the background, there appears to be some foliage and what could be buildings or structures, but they are not clearly defined. However, there is no indication of any individuals present in the scene.

It's worth noting that the absence of people in the photograph does not necessarily mean that there were no witnesses or victims involved in the incident depicted. It's possible that people may have been evacuated from the area before the photo was taken or that they are simply out of frame. Without more context or information, it is impossible to determine whether anyone was present at the time the photo was taken.
