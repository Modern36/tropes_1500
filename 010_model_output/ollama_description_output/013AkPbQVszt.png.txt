The photograph features a large statue of a man's bust on top of a rectangular stone pillar with the name "Ibsen" inscribed at the base. The statue appears to be made of bronze or another metal and has a dark patina.

In front of the statue, there are several people standing in two rows. The first row consists of three men wearing suits and hats, while the second row has five women dressed in long skirts and blouses. They all appear to be looking at the camera with serious expressions.

Behind the group of people, there is a building with a large window on the left side. The sky above is overcast, suggesting that it may have been taken on a cloudy day.

Overall, the image suggests that this could be a historical event or ceremony related to Henrik Ibsen, a famous Norwegian playwright and poet. The presence of dignitaries and the formal attire worn by the individuals in the photograph support this interpretation.
