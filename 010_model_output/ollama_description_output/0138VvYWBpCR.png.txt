There are no people visible in the photograph you've provided. The image appears to be a black-and-white still life or product photo of an antique silver pitcher or jug with a handle on its side and a decorative lid, possibly taken for historical documentation or cataloging purposes within a museum collection.

Since there are no individuals present in the scene, it is not possible to identify any people by gender, age, clothing, or other distinguishing features. The focus of the image is solely on the object itself, which suggests that the photograph was intended to capture detailed information about the artifact rather than depict human subjects.
