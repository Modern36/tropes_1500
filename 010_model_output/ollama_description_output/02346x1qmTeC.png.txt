This black-and-white photograph depicts two small children. A baby sits in a stroller, while an older child stands beside it.

The baby has light hair and wears a dress with short sleeves. The older child also has light-colored hair and is dressed in dark pants and a shirt with long sleeves.

To the left of the image, there appears to be a third person sitting on a bench, although they are out of focus. This individual's features are indistinguishable due to the blurriness.

In the background, several additional people can be seen, but their facial features are too blurry to discern. They appear to be wearing dark clothing and hats.

The overall atmosphere suggests that this photograph was taken in a park or other outdoor setting during the early 20th century.
