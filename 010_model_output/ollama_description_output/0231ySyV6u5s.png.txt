There do not appear to be any people visible in this image. The photograph appears to show a black-and-white railway station scene with no individuals present. 

The closest thing to people seen in this photo might be the figures of two or three people on the platform, but they are very small and indistinct due to being far away from the camera and out of focus. It is impossible to determine any details about these figures, including their gender, age, or clothing.

It's worth noting that the image appears to be an old photograph, possibly taken in the early 20th century, based on the style and quality of the image. However, without more context or information about the specific location or time period depicted in the photo, it is difficult to say for certain when or where it was taken.

Overall, while there may be some faint suggestions of human presence in the background of this image, they are too indistinct to provide any meaningful details about gender, age, or clothing.
