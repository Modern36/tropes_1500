The image shows a black-and-white photograph of an older woman wearing a coat with fur trim on the collar and cuffs. She appears to be standing outside, possibly near a building or in front of a backdrop.

**Key Features:**

* The woman's face is blurred, making it difficult to discern her features.
* Her hair is styled in a bobbed haircut, which was popular during the early 20th century.
* She wears a long coat with fur trim on the collar and cuffs, suggesting that the photo may have been taken during winter or in a cold climate.
* The background of the image appears to be out of focus, but it seems to show a building or structure behind the woman.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the available information, I conclude that there is only one person visible in this photograph - an older woman. Her gender can be inferred from her clothing and hairstyle, which are consistent with those worn by women during the early 20th century.
