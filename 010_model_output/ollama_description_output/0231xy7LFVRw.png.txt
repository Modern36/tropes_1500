There do not appear to be any people visible in this image. The photograph shows a train station with tracks running through it and buildings on either side. There are no individuals or groups present in the scene, and there is no indication of human activity beyond the presence of the trains and infrastructure.

Therefore, I must conclude that there are no men, women, children, or any other type of person visible in this image.
