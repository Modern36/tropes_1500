The image depicts a black-and-white photograph of a train station, with two men standing outside the building. The man on the left is wearing a dark jacket and hat, while the man on the right is dressed in lighter attire. Both individuals are positioned near the entrance to the station.

In the background, there appears to be another person inside the train car, although their features are not clearly visible due to the distance and quality of the image. Additionally, there may be other people present in the scene who are partially obscured by objects or out of focus.

Overall, based on the clothing worn by the individuals in the foreground, it can be inferred that they are likely male adults. However, without more detailed information or higher-resolution imagery, it is difficult to make definitive conclusions about the gender or age of all the people depicted in the photograph.
