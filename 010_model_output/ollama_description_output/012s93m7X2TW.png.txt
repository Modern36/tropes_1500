The image shows a black-and-white photograph of a plate of food on a tablecloth with a floral pattern. The food appears to be some kind of dessert, possibly cheesecake or creme brûlée, topped with fruit and nuts. The plate is white and has a decorative edge. The background is out of focus but seems to show a table setting with other plates, glasses, and utensils.
