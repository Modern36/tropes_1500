The photograph features three individuals, all dressed in attire typical of the early 20th century. The person on the left wears a long-sleeved shirt with buttons down the front and dark pants tucked into knee-high boots. A wide leather belt encircles their waist, and they have a cap on their head. They are holding a large cylindrical object that appears to be made of metal or wood.

In the middle stands another person, similarly attired in a long-sleeved shirt with buttons down the front and dark pants tucked into knee-high boots. This individual also wears a wide leather belt around their waist but has no cap on their head. They are not holding any objects.

On the right side of the photograph is a third person, again dressed in a long-sleeved shirt with buttons down the front and dark pants tucked into knee-high boots. Like the others, they wear a wide leather belt around their waist and have no cap on their head. This person is also not holding any objects.

All three individuals are standing in what appears to be a field or open area, with trees visible in the background. The sky above them is overcast, casting a gloomy tone over the scene. Despite the lack of clear facial features due to the image's age and quality, it is possible to discern that all three people are likely male based on their clothing and hairstyles, which were common for men during this time period.
