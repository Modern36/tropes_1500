The photograph depicts a scene with two individuals standing on the platform of a train station. The person on the left appears to be wearing dark pants and a light-colored jacket or coat, while the person on the right is dressed in lighter attire. Although it's challenging to determine their gender due to the distance and quality of the image, based on their clothing, it can be inferred that they are likely men.

In the background, there are no other people visible within the photograph. The focus of the image seems to be on the train station itself rather than any individuals present in the scene.
