The photograph depicts two individuals in a boat on the water. The person at the front of the boat appears to be male, as indicated by his attire and hairstyle. He is wearing what seems to be a hat or head covering, which was common for men during that time period.

In contrast, the individual sitting in the back of the boat is more difficult to identify due to their position and lack of clear facial features. However, based on their clothing and posture, it is possible that they are also male. They appear to be wearing a long-sleeved shirt or jacket, which was typical attire for both men and women during this era.

It's important to note that the photograph is not particularly detailed or well-lit, making it challenging to discern specific features or characteristics of the individuals depicted. Additionally, cultural norms and social expectations around gender roles may have influenced how people presented themselves in public settings during this time period.

Overall, while some assumptions can be made about the gender identity of the individuals in the photograph based on their clothing and hairstyles, it is essential to approach these interpretations with caution and consider multiple perspectives when analyzing historical images.
