The photograph depicts a woman standing in front of a wooden building, likely taken during the early 20th century. The woman is dressed in a long-sleeved dress with a high neckline and a full skirt that falls just below her knees. Her hair is styled in an updo, and she wears a pair of gloves on her hands.

In the background, there appears to be another person or people partially hidden by the wooden building. However, due to the poor quality of the image, it is difficult to determine their gender or any other details about them.

Overall, based on the clothing and hairstyles depicted in the photograph, it can be inferred that the individuals are likely women from the early 20th century.
