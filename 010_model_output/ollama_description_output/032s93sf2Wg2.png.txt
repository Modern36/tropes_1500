The photograph features two women standing side by side against a wall, with their feet shoulder-width apart and hands clasped behind their backs. They wear identical dark-colored swimsuits adorned with white stripes on the shoulders and hips.

Behind them stands another woman, dressed in a light-colored blouse and darker skirt or pants, who appears to be overseeing or instructing the two women in front of her. Her attire suggests that she may not be participating in the same activity as the other two individuals. 

The background of the image is out of focus, but it seems to depict an indoor swimming pool setting. The overall atmosphere suggests a formal and structured environment, possibly related to competitive swimming or aquatic training.
