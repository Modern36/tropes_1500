There are no people visible in this photograph. The image appears to be a black-and-white or sepia-toned picture of an old church or building, possibly taken from a historical collection. The structure is centered in the frame and features a prominent steeple with a cross on top. In front of the building, there is a graveyard with several headstones scattered throughout.

The atmosphere of the image suggests that it may have been taken during the daytime, as the lighting appears natural rather than artificial. However, due to the lack of people in the scene, it's difficult to determine the exact time of day or any specific activities taking place. Overall, the photograph presents a serene and peaceful depiction of an old church surrounded by its graveyard.
