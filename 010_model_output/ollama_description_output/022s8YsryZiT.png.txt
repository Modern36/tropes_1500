The photograph depicts a historic street scene with several individuals present. However, due to the low resolution and faded quality of the image, it is challenging to discern any specific details about these people.

Upon closer examination, there appear to be at least five distinct figures visible in the picture. Unfortunately, their facial features are not clear enough to determine gender or age accurately. The attire worn by these individuals suggests a time period likely from the early 20th century, but without more context or higher image quality, it's difficult to pinpoint an exact era.

Given the limitations of the photograph, I must refer to these figures as 'people' rather than attempting to assign specific genders or ages. It is essential to acknowledge that historical images often require careful interpretation and consideration of the cultural and social contexts in which they were created.
