There are a total of 6 people visible in this image. Three individuals stand at the front entrance of the building, while three others appear on the platform behind it. The photograph's resolution does not allow for clear identification of each person's gender.

The person positioned centrally near the main door is dressed in dark attire and a hat that casts a shadow over their face, obscuring any distinguishing features. To their left stands another individual wearing light-colored clothing, but their facial details remain unclear due to the image quality. The third person, situated on the far right of the entrance, wears a lighter-hued outfit but is partially obscured by the doorframe.

On the platform behind them are three additional figures: one standing near the center and two others positioned at the edges. All five individuals appear to be wearing hats or head coverings that make it difficult to discern any defining characteristics.
