The photograph depicts a group of five individuals seated on a wooden cart, with two additional figures standing behind them. The people are attired in traditional clothing from the early 20th century.

In the foreground, four women and one man are visible. The man is dressed in dark attire and a hat, while the women wear light-colored dresses and headscarves. Behind this group, another woman stands with her back to the camera, wearing a dark dress and apron. A second figure, possibly a child or young adult, is partially obscured by the cart's wheel.

The people appear to be engaged in some form of labor or activity related to the cart, although the exact nature of their task is unclear. The background of the image features a rural landscape with trees and fields, suggesting that the scene may be set on a farm or in a similar agricultural context.
