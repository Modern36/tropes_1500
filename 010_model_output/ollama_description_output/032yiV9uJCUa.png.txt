The photograph features a single person, who appears to be a man. He is dressed in formal attire, including a suit jacket, white shirt, bow tie, and a sailor's cap with a round emblem on it. The man sits on the left side of the image, holding an object that resembles a microphone or similar instrument.

In the background, there are several objects visible, but no other people can be seen. The setting appears to be indoors, possibly in a room or studio decorated for a celebration or special occasion.
