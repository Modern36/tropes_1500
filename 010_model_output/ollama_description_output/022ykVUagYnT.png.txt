There are no people visible in this photograph.

The image depicts a rural scene with a dirt road or path leading up to a fence, beyond which cattle are grazing. The focus of the photo appears to be on the landscape and the animals rather than any human subjects. 

Given the absence of individuals within the frame, it is not possible to identify gender based on clothing or other visual cues as there are no people present in the image.
