There appears to be one person in the photograph. They seem to be a man, dressed in a long coat, standing on the left side of the image near a row of cars parked along the road. His face is not visible as he seems to have his back turned towards the camera.

The main focus of the picture appears to be the old cars rather than people, but there might be more individuals present that are out of frame or obscured from view.
