There are two individuals visible in the photograph.

In the foreground, there is a woman wearing a long dress with a white collar and dark shoes. She has short hair and is holding a bouquet of flowers or a plant. The woman appears to be standing next to a man who is slightly taller than her. He is dressed in a suit and tie, with his left arm around the woman's waist. 

In the background, there are no other people visible as it appears that the couple are posing for a formal portrait against a plain backdrop.
