The photograph you provided is a portrait of a woman. The image is in black and white, so it's difficult to determine her exact age or any other details about her appearance beyond what can be seen in the photo.

In terms of gender, based on the clothing she wears - a dress with long sleeves and a high neckline - I would identify this person as female. Her hair appears to be styled neatly under a hat or head covering, which was common for women during the time period when this photograph was taken (likely early 20th century). 

There are no other people visible in the background or out of focus areas of the image that I can see. Overall, while there isn't much information available about this individual beyond their physical appearance and attire, they seem to be a woman from an earlier era who has been captured by someone's camera lens for posterity sake alone - perhaps as part of some sort of family album collection?
