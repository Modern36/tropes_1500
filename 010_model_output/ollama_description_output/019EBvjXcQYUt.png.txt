The photograph depicts two men standing on a snow-covered surface, likely an ice rink or frozen pond. The man on the left is dressed in dark attire and appears to be holding a broom or similar tool, while the man on the right wears lighter-colored clothing and has his hands clasped together behind his back.

In the background, there are several buildings visible, including what appears to be a large wooden structure with multiple windows and doors. Additionally, there is a smaller building in the distance that may be a shed or storage facility. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a cold winter day, with snow covering the ground and the men bundled up against the chill.

It's worth noting that the photograph appears to have been taken during the early 20th century, based on the style of clothing worn by the men and the architecture of the buildings in the background. Overall, the image provides a glimpse into daily life during this time period, highlighting the importance of outdoor activities like ice skating and the need for warmth and protection from the elements.
