The photograph features a young girl sitting on a chair, facing away from the camera. She has short hair and is dressed in a light-colored dress with a dark collar and sleeves. Her legs are crossed at the ankles, and she appears to be holding something in her hands.

In the background, there is another person standing behind the girl, but their features are not clearly visible due to the distance and focus of the camera. This individual could be either male or female, as no distinctive characteristics can be discerned from the image.

There do not appear to be any other people present in the photograph beyond these two individuals. The scene seems to capture a quiet moment between the girl and the person standing behind her, with no other figures visible in the surrounding environment.
