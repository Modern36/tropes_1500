The photograph depicts two women working on a lawn using gardening tools.

In the foreground, one woman is wearing a dress with a floral pattern and a headscarf, while holding a rake in her right hand. The second woman, positioned behind the first, is dressed in a light-colored dress and has short hair. She appears to be operating a wheelbarrow or similar device with handles.

The background of the image features trees and bushes, which are out of focus but still visible. There do not appear to be any other people present in the photograph beyond these two women.
