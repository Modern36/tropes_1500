The photograph appears to show a man standing against a wall, dressed in formal attire.

He has short dark hair that is neatly combed back away from his face. He wears a suit with a white shirt and a patterned tie, which is tucked into the top of his high-waisted trousers. The jacket is single-breasted, fastened at one button, and features two flap pockets on either side. A small pin adorns his left lapel.

The background consists of a plain wall that appears to be made from wooden panels.
