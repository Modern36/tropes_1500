This photograph shows a bride and groom with two other people who appear to be part of the wedding party.

The bride sits at the bottom of the image wearing a white dress and holds a bouquet in her lap. Her hair is styled under a veil, which falls behind her shoulders. She appears to be smiling, but it's difficult to tell because her face is heavily damaged by age or wear. The groom stands next to the bride with his arm around her. He wears a dark suit and tie, along with a white shirt. His face also shows signs of aging and damage.

To their left stand two other people who appear to be part of the wedding party. One person wears a light-colored dress while another has on a dark suit similar to that worn by the groom. Both individuals have their arms around each other as if they are embracing or supporting one another during this special occasion. Their faces also show signs of aging and damage due to age or wear.

In addition to these four main subjects, there are no other people visible in the background or out-of-focus areas of the photograph. Overall, it appears that all individuals depicted here were likely participants in a wedding ceremony captured many years ago based on their attire alone without any additional context provided about when exactly this photo was taken (although judging from clothing styles alone would suggest sometime between late 19th century through mid-20th century).
