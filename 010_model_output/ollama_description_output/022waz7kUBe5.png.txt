The photograph depicts a bride and groom on their wedding day. The woman, likely the bride, is wearing a long white dress with a veil covering her face. She has dark hair styled in an updo and is holding a bouquet of flowers. 

To her left stands a man, possibly the groom, dressed in a black suit with a white shirt and tie. His dark hair is neatly combed back.

In the background, there are several people who appear to be guests at the wedding. They are all dressed formally, with men wearing suits and women wearing dresses or skirts. Some of them are smiling or looking towards the camera, while others seem distracted or focused on something else in the scene.
