The photograph depicts a serene scene of a boat docked at a pier, with a few people visible in the background. The individuals are not clearly defined due to the black and white tone and the distance from which they were captured.

In the foreground, there appears to be one person standing on the pier, but their features are indistinguishable. In the background, several other figures can be seen walking along the shore or sitting on benches. However, it is impossible to determine their gender or any distinguishing characteristics due to the lack of color and clarity in the image.

Overall, while there are people present in the photograph, they are not the primary focus and are more like silhouettes against the backdrop of the boat and pier.
