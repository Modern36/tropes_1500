The photograph shows a black and white image of a man jumping over a long jump pit.

There are five men standing together at the side of the track watching him, all wearing suits and ties. They appear to be officials or spectators. The jumper is wearing shorts and what appears to be a singlet with a number on it. 

In the background there is another man sitting down in front of an official's table, wearing a suit and tie.

The image is very grainy and out of focus.
