There are no people visible in this photograph. The image appears to be a black-and-white picture of a wooden crate or box with the number "4" painted on it, filled with coal or rocks. Two men are standing next to the crate, but they are not clearly visible due to the low resolution and quality of the image.

The man on the left is wearing a hat and has his back turned towards the camera. He appears to be holding something in his hand, possibly a tool or an object related to the coal or rocks. The man on the right is partially obscured by the crate, but he seems to be looking down at it with interest.

In the background, there are some indistinct shapes that could potentially be other people or objects, but they are too blurry to make out clearly. Overall, while there may be additional individuals present in the scene, only two men can be identified as being directly involved with the crate and its contents.
