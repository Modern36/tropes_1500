There appears to be one person in this photograph. The person is a man who appears to have on dark pants with a light-colored shirt and possibly a hat. He is wearing boots or shoes, but it's difficult to tell because of his position. 

The man is standing in the middle of the image near what appears to be a small building that may be a train station or depot. There are some trees and bushes around him, and there is a train track running through the center of the image. In the background, there are more buildings and structures, including what looks like a water tower.

Overall, the man seems to be waiting for something - possibly a train - and he appears to be dressed in casual clothing suitable for everyday activities.
