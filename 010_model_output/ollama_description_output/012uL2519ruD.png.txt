The photograph depicts a man standing beside an object resembling a boat hull, with another person visible in the background. The man on the left is dressed in attire typical for his era, including a cap, jacket, vest, shirt, tie, trousers, and shoes. He stands next to what appears to be a partially constructed boat or ship's hull, which features a metal frame and wooden planks.

In the background, there are at least two other people, one of whom is wearing a hat and standing near the wall on the right side of the image. The presence of these individuals suggests that they may be involved in the construction or repair of boats or ships, possibly as workers or sailors.
