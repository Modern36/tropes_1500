The image depicts a church interior with pews and an altar, but there are no people visible in the photograph. The scene appears to be set for a religious service or ceremony, with various objects such as flowers, candles, and religious symbols present on the altar. However, there is no indication of any individuals participating in the event.

Given the lack of human figures in the image, it is not possible to identify specific men, women, children, or people based on their appearance. The focus of the photograph seems to be on capturing the architectural details and atmosphere of the church rather than showcasing individuals. Therefore, without further context or additional images, it cannot be determined who might have been involved in this scene beyond what is visible in the provided photograph.
