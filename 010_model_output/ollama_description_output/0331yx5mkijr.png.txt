The photograph depicts three men standing together, each holding a tool. The man on the left wears a dark jacket and hat, while the middle man sports a lighter-colored shirt with vertical stripes and a cap. The individual on the right is attired in a darker jacket and hat.

In the background, there are no other visible people. However, it appears that the men are situated near some sort of structure or machinery, as evidenced by various objects scattered around them. These objects include what seems to be a large pipe or tube lying on the ground behind the men, as well as several smaller items such as tools or equipment.

Overall, based on their clothing and the context in which they are depicted, it can be inferred that these individuals are likely workers engaged in some form of manual labor.
