The photograph shows a large group of men standing in formation on what appears to be a parade ground or drill field. They are all wearing military uniforms, which suggests that they are soldiers.

In the foreground, there are several individuals who appear to be officers or non-commissioned officers (NCOs). They are distinguished by their insignia and badges, as well as their slightly different uniforms. One officer is standing at attention in front of the formation, while another is walking towards him from the right side of the image.

Behind the main group of soldiers, there is a row of trees or buildings that provides some depth to the scene. In the background, there may be additional people who are not clearly visible due to the distance and quality of the photograph. However, it does not appear that any children are present in the image.

Overall, based on their clothing and context, it seems likely that all the people depicted in this photograph are adult men serving in a military capacity.
