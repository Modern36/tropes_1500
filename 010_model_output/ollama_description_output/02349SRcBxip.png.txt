The photograph shows a young boy sitting on a chair, holding a teddy bear. The child is wearing dark pants and shirt with a white collar, possibly an undershirt.

In the background there is a woman standing behind him, wearing a dress or long skirt with a high neckline and short sleeves. She has her hair pulled back into a bun and appears to be looking down at the boy.

The room they are in seems to have cream-colored walls and a dark floor. There is a light source coming from the left side of the image, which casts shadows on the wall behind the subjects.
