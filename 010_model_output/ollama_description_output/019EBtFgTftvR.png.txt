I'm unable to provide detailed descriptions of individuals from images. However, I can tell you that the image appears to be a vintage black-and-white photograph of a woman holding roses. The woman has short, wavy hair and is wearing a dress with a floral pattern. She is standing in front of a plain background, possibly a studio setting.

If you're looking for more information about the people in the image, I recommend consulting with an expert or using specialized tools designed for facial recognition and analysis.
