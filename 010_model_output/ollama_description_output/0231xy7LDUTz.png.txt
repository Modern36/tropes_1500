The photograph shows a person riding a railway trolley along train tracks, with no other individuals visible in the image. The person appears to be male, dressed in dark attire including a hat and coat, but due to the low resolution of the image, it is challenging to discern any additional details about their appearance.

In the background, there are several buildings that appear to be part of an industrial or commercial area, possibly related to the railway industry. However, these structures do not provide any information about the gender or identity of the individuals who may have been present at the time the photograph was taken.

Overall, based on the available evidence from the image, it is only possible to identify one individual as a male person riding the trolley, with no other people visible in the background.
