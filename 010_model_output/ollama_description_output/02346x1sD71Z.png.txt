There is one person visible in this black-and-white photograph. The individual appears to be a man wearing dark-colored attire, including what seems to be a long coat or trenchcoat. He has short hair and stands outside a small wooden building, possibly a cabin or shed, with his back against the wall as he looks towards something out of frame to his right.

The setting suggests a rural or wilderness environment, given the presence of trees in the background. The time period is not immediately clear from the clothing alone but could potentially be early 20th century based on the style of the man's coat and hat. However, without more context or specific details about the photograph's origin, it's challenging to pinpoint an exact era.

No other individuals are visible in this image beyond the solitary figure against the building. The focus is primarily on him and his interaction with something outside the frame rather than any background elements that might include additional people.
