The photograph you provided does not depict any individuals. The image appears to be a black-and-white scene of a winter landscape with snow-covered ground and trees in the background, featuring several buildings or structures that resemble houses or cabins. In the foreground, there is a fence made of wooden posts and wire mesh, which adds depth to the composition.

Since no people are visible in this photograph, it is not possible for me to identify their gender based on clothing or any other visual cues. The focus of the image seems to be on capturing the serene winter atmosphere rather than portraying human subjects.
