The photograph depicts a large group of people gathered on the deck of a boat, with some individuals standing at the bow and others seated or leaning against the railings. The majority of these people appear to be men, dressed in formal attire such as suits and hats, while there are only a few women present, wearing long dresses and head coverings.

In addition to the main group on the deck, several other people can be seen in the background, including sailors working on the ship's rigging or standing at attention along the railings. Some of these individuals may also be men, but their features are not clearly visible due to the distance and quality of the image.

Overall, based on the clothing and hairstyles depicted in the photograph, it is likely that most of the people shown are adult males, with a smaller number of females present as well. However, without more detailed information or higher-resolution imagery, it is impossible to determine the exact gender distribution among all individuals visible in the photo.
