The image depicts a group of 11 individuals, all dressed in costumes, posing for a photograph. The majority of them appear to be adults, with no children visible.

In terms of gender, it is challenging to determine with certainty due to the fact that they are wearing disguises and masks. However, based on their attire and hairstyles, some can be identified as men or women.

There are three individuals who may be women, dressed in traditional female clothing such as dresses and hats. Additionally, there are two people who could potentially be children, although this is not clear due to the poor quality of the photograph.

The remaining six individuals are likely men, given their masculine attire and facial hair. One person stands out as possibly being a woman, wearing a dress and hat that appears more feminine than the others.

It's worth noting that the image was taken during a time when gender roles were less fluid, making it easier to make assumptions about someone's gender based on their appearance. However, without more context or information, it is impossible to say for certain whether these individuals identify as men or women.
