The photograph contains four images, each depicting a person or people engaged in various activities. The first image shows two individuals standing on either side of a boat, with one person holding an oar and the other appearing to be preparing for departure. Both figures are dressed in traditional Sami attire, which is characterized by colorful patterns and designs.

In the second image, three people are visible: two adults and one child. They are all wearing similar clothing to those in the first image, suggesting that they may also be from the same cultural background as the individuals depicted in the previous photo.

The third image features a single person who appears to be older than the others shown in the previous photos. This individual is also dressed in traditional Sami clothing and is standing alone near what looks like a wooden structure or building.

Finally, the fourth image depicts two people sitting together on a rocky outcropping, both wearing similar outfits to those seen in earlier images. One of them appears to be playing a musical instrument, while the other listens intently.

Overall, based on their clothing and hairstyles, it seems likely that most if not all of these individuals are men or boys. However, without more context or information about the specific culture being depicted here, it's difficult to say for certain whether any women or girls might also be present in these scenes.
