The image is a black-and-white photograph of a building under construction, with scaffolding and workers visible. The workers are wearing hats and overalls, but it's difficult to determine their gender due to the distance and quality of the image.

**Key Observations:**

*   **Workers:** There are several workers on the scaffolding, but they appear as small figures in the distance.
*   **Clothing:** The workers wear hats and overalls, which were common attire for both men and women during this time period.
*   **Distance and Quality:** Due to the distance and quality of the image, it's challenging to discern any distinguishing features that might indicate gender.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the available information, it's not possible to determine the gender of the workers in the photograph. The clothing worn by the workers does not provide clear evidence of their gender, and the distance and quality of the image make it difficult to observe any other distinguishing characteristics. Therefore, I must conclude that the individuals depicted in the photograph are people whose gender cannot be determined from this image alone.
