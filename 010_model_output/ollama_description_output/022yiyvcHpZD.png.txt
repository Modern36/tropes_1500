There are no people visible in this photograph. The image depicts a large building engulfed in flames, with smoke billowing into the air. The scene appears to be one of destruction and chaos, but there are no individuals present in the frame.

The absence of people in the photo makes it impossible to determine their gender or any other characteristics. Therefore, I must conclude that there are no men, women, children, or people of any kind visible in this image.
