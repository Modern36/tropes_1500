There are two people in this photograph, standing on a path behind a pile of rocks. The person on the left appears to be wearing long trousers, with what looks like a dark jacket or coat, and light-colored shoes. Their hair appears to be tied back, but it is difficult to discern due to low quality of the image. Behind them, there is another person who seems to be wearing a hat and a long-sleeved shirt with trousers.

In terms of distinguishing features, it is challenging to make out any defining characteristics such as facial features or body language due to the distance and poor quality of the image. However, based on their clothing and hairstyles, it appears that both individuals are adults, likely men given the style of their attire during this time period (although without clearer details about their faces or bodies, we cannot say for certain).
