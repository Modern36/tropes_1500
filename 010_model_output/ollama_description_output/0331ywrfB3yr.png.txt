There are no people present in this photograph. The image depicts a house surrounded by trees and bushes, with a fence in front of it. There are also two cars parked on the street outside the house.

The absence of people in the photo suggests that it may have been taken at an early hour or during a quiet moment when no one was around. Alternatively, the photographer may have intentionally focused on capturing the architecture and surroundings rather than including human subjects.
