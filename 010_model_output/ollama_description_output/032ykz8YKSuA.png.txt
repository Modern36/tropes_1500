The photograph shows a man standing behind a woman who is seated on a white chair with her hands folded over her knees. The man wears a dark suit, tie, and boots. He has short dark hair and looks at the camera with a neutral expression.

The woman sits in front of him with her body facing slightly to the left. She wears a long dark dress with buttons down the front and white cuffs visible below her sleeves. Her light-colored hair is pulled back into a bun, and she gazes directly at the camera with an enigmatic smile.

A large crack runs diagonally across the photograph from top right to bottom left, partially obscuring the woman's face. The background behind them appears to be a painted backdrop featuring trees, a house, and a fence.

The overall atmosphere of this portrait suggests that it was taken in a studio setting during the early 20th century when formal portraits were common among families who could afford such services.
