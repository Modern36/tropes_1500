The photograph shows a black-and-white image of a park with a fountain, featuring several individuals in the foreground and background. 

In the foreground, there is one person sitting on a bench near the fountain. This individual is wearing dark clothing and appears to be a man due to his attire. He has short hair and is looking down at something in his hands.

Behind the bench where he sits, there are two more people walking towards the right side of the image. They appear to be women based on their clothing, which includes long dresses that were common during this time period. Both have hats on their heads, adding further support for identifying them as female figures within the scene depicted here.

There is another person visible in the background who appears to be a woman due to her dress and hairstyle. She is standing near some trees and looking towards the camera with an expression that suggests she might be posing for the photo or simply enjoying the scenery around her.

Overall, there are four people shown throughout this image: one man sitting on a bench near the fountain; two women walking behind him; and another woman standing alone in the distance surrounded by trees.
