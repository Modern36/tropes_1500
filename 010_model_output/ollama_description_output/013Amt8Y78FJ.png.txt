The photograph features a single individual, who appears to be an adult male. He is dressed in attire typical of the early 20th century, including a hat, coat, and pants. The man's facial features are not clearly visible due to the low resolution of the image.

In the background, there are several other people present, although they are not as prominent or well-defined as the central figure. These individuals appear to be adults, but their genders cannot be determined with certainty due to the lack of detail in the image. They seem to be engaged in various activities, such as walking or standing, and may be part of a larger group or crowd.

Overall, while it is difficult to discern specific details about the people in this photograph, it is clear that they are all adults and likely from the early 20th century based on their clothing and hairstyles.
