The photograph captures a military scene with soldiers standing at attention, forming two distinct groups. 

In the foreground, approximately 20 men, likely officers or non-commissioned officers (NCOs), face away from the camera and towards the right side of the image. They are dressed in formal military attire, including dark-colored jackets adorned with medals on their left chest, light-colored trousers, and tall hats featuring a narrow brim and indented crown.

In the background, between 100 and 200 soldiers stand at attention, facing the front. Although they appear to be wearing similar uniforms to those in the foreground, their features are less distinct due to the distance from the camera. They seem to have dark-colored jackets with light-colored trousers. Some of these individuals wear tall hats like those in the foreground, while others do not.

Beyond this group, additional people can be seen standing along the top edge of the image. However, they are too far away and out of focus to discern any details about their appearance or gender.
