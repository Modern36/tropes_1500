There appear to be three men wearing coats and hats in this photograph. They are standing close together.

The man on the left has his back turned away from the camera so he cannot be seen clearly. The man in the centre appears to be smiling at the other two people, while the person on the right is looking directly at the camera.

All three individuals appear to be wearing long coats with buttons down the front and fedora-style hats. They also wear suits underneath their coats. All of them are wearing glasses.
