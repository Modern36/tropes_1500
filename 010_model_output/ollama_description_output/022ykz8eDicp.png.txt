The photograph features a young girl with short hair, dressed in a dark-colored dress adorned with white buttons down the front. She wears a light-colored collar and has her hands clasped together in front of her.

In the background, there are no other individuals visible within the frame. The overall atmosphere suggests that this is likely a portrait or formal photograph of the young girl, possibly taken during the early 20th century based on her attire and hairstyle.
