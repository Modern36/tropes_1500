The image depicts a group of five children seated beneath a tree, with one child standing behind them. The children are dressed in attire typical for the early 20th century, including hats and coats. Although their faces are not clearly visible due to the black-and-white nature of the photograph, it is possible to discern some features.

In the background, there appears to be a body of water or a lake, surrounded by trees and other foliage. The overall atmosphere suggests a serene and peaceful setting, possibly during a family outing or picnic.
