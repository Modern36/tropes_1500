There are no individuals visible in this photograph. The scene appears to depict an old watermill or similar structure, with a small waterfall and a building in the background. There is also what seems to be another person standing on the right side of the image.

The setting suggests that it may have been taken during the daytime, possibly in a rural area given the presence of trees and a body of water. However, without more context or information about the photograph's origin, it is difficult to say for certain when exactly it was captured.
