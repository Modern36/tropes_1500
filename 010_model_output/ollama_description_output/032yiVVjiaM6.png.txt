The photograph depicts a butcher shop interior, featuring various meats and food items on display. In the center of the image, behind the counter, stands an older man wearing a white apron with dark stripes or piping around the edges. His attire suggests that he may be the owner or an employee of the establishment.

On the left side of the image, near the front window, is another individual who appears to be a customer. This person is partially obscured by objects in the foreground, making it challenging to discern their age or gender with certainty. However, based on their attire and hairstyle, they seem to be an adult male.

In the background, there are several other people visible through the storefront windows. These individuals appear to be pedestrians walking along the sidewalk outside the shop. Due to the distance and the fact that they are not directly facing the camera, it is difficult to determine their ages or genders with precision. Nevertheless, they add context to the scene, indicating that the butcher shop is situated in a bustling urban environment.

Overall, the image presents a snapshot of daily life within a butcher shop during this time period. The presence of multiple individuals highlights the social aspect of such businesses, where customers interacted with vendors and each other while going about their daily routines.
