The image shows two individuals standing beside a vintage car. The person on the left wears a hat and coat with buttons down the front, which suggests they might be male, although it's hard to say for certain without clearer details of their face or attire that would typically indicate gender. On the right stands another individual in a long coat and hat as well; again, while these elements lean towards traditional masculine garb from the era depicted, identification based solely on clothing can sometimes mislead us regarding sex determination.

In the background, there are several other people visible but not clearly enough defined to determine their gender with any confidence. Some appear dressed similarly to those in the foreground, suggesting possible males given historical norms around attire; however, without direct visual cues like facial features or distinctive accessories traditionally associated with one gender over another during this time period, we cannot make definitive calls about the sex of these background figures.

Given these observations and considering the limitations imposed by both the distance from the camera and the quality of the photograph itself, it seems prudent to refer to all individuals present within the image simply as "people" rather than attempting more specific gender classifications that could easily prove inaccurate upon closer inspection or with additional context not provided here.
