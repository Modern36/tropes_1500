There are no people visible in this photograph. The image appears to be a vintage or historical scene, possibly depicting a street or road with cobblestones and old-fashioned buildings along the sides. However, there are no individuals present in the frame.

If you would like me to describe other elements of the image, such as vehicles, architecture, or objects, I can do so. Alternatively, if you have any specific questions about the photograph's context or historical significance, I'll be happy to try and assist you further.
