There is one woman in this photograph. She has her hair braided into two plaits. Her attire consists of a dark dress with long sleeves and lace details around the collar area, paired with black stockings and shoes. The overall style suggests that she may be from an earlier era, possibly during the early 20th century or even before.

The woman is seated in a chair positioned beside a table holding a vase with flowers. Her posture indicates that she is posing for the photograph, as her back is straight and her hands are placed gracefully on her lap. The background of the image features a plain wall adorned with a few pieces of artwork, which adds to the sense of formality and elegance.
