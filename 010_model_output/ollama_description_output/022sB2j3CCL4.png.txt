She is attired in a long-sleeved dress featuring vertical stripes and adorned with a brooch at her neckline. Her hair is styled in an updo, complemented by a hat positioned atop her head. The woman's right hand rests on the arm of the chair, while her left hand holds a cane.

In the background, there are no other individuals visible within the frame. The overall atmosphere of the image exudes elegance and sophistication, characteristic of early 20th-century portraiture photography.
