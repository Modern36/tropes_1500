The photograph features a bride and groom, with the bride on the left and the groom on the right. The bride has dark hair styled in an updo, adorned with a veil that extends from her headpiece down her back. She wears white gloves reaching past her elbows and a long-sleeved wedding dress with a high neckline and lace overlay. A small bouquet is visible in her hands.

The groom stands beside the bride, wearing a suit jacket, vest, shirt, tie, pants, and shoes. His hair is slicked back, and he has a mustache. In his left hand, he holds a top hat, while his right arm is around the bride's waist.

In the background, there are two women standing behind the couple. One woman wears a dark dress with a high neckline and long sleeves, while the other woman wears a light-colored dress with a high neckline and short sleeves. Both women have their hair styled in buns and wear hats or headpieces.

Overall, the image captures a formal wedding scene from the early 20th century, with the bride and groom posing for a photograph surrounded by family members or friends.
