In terms of age, it is challenging to determine an exact range without more context or information about the individual's life stage at the time the photo was taken. However, based on his demeanor and attire, he could be anywhere from late adolescence to middle adulthood.

There are no other people visible in the background or out-of-focus areas of the image. The subject is centered and takes up most of the frame, with minimal distractions or context clues that might provide additional information about him or his surroundings.
