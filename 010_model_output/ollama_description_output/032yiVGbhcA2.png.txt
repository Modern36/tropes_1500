There appears to be two people in the photograph. 

The person on the left is wearing a long coat and standing behind what seems to be some sort of tank or container. The person on the right is dressed in a white apron, possibly indicating that they are involved in some kind of industrial process.

It's challenging to determine the gender of these individuals based solely on their clothing, as it doesn't provide clear indicators. Therefore, I will refer to them as "people" rather than assigning a specific gender.
