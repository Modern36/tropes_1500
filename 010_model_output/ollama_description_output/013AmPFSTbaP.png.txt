The photograph depicts a group of soldiers gathered around vehicles, with several individuals standing in the background. The soldiers are attired in military uniforms and helmets, while those in the background appear to be wearing civilian clothing.

In the foreground, there are approximately 20 soldiers visible, all of whom are men. They are positioned near the vehicles, which include cars and trucks. Some of the soldiers are leaning against the vehicles or sitting on them, while others are standing nearby.

Behind the soldiers, there is a large crowd of people gathered in the background. It is difficult to discern any specific details about these individuals due to their distance from the camera and the fact that they are out of focus. However, it appears that most of them are men, although there may be some women present as well.

Overall, based on the clothing worn by the individuals in the photograph, it can be inferred that the majority of people depicted are male.
