There do not appear to be any people visible in this image. It depicts a black-and-white photograph of horses plowing a field with two men standing behind them. The men wear hats and long-sleeved shirts, but it's impossible to discern any other details about their faces or body language due to the distance from which they are being photographed.

The background shows rolling hills stretching out into the distance under an overcast sky, giving off a sense of serenity despite the manual labor taking place in the foreground. Overall, while there may be some people present at this scene, none can be clearly identified or described beyond these basic observations.
