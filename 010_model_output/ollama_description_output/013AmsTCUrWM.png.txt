The photograph depicts a group of six men standing with their bicycles on what appears to be a country road. The image features several individuals with varying levels of visibility and clarity.

There are two individuals in the foreground, positioned centrally within the frame. One man is wearing a dark suit jacket with a white shirt underneath, while the other sports a lighter-colored suit jacket paired with a tie. Both men have dark hair and mustaches. 

Behind them stand four additional people, although their features are less distinct due to being out of focus. Three of these individuals wear light-colored clothing, including one person who is donning a hat. The fourth person in the background wears darker attire.

In summary, there appear to be six men present within this historical photograph.
