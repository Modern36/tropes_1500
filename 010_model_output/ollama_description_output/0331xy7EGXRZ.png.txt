There do not appear to be any individuals visible in this image. The photograph depicts a train station or railroad yard with tracks, trains, and buildings, but no people are present. The scene is empty of human figures, suggesting that it may have been taken during a quiet moment or when the area was closed to the public.

If you would like me to describe other elements in the image, such as vehicles, buildings, or objects, I can do so based on what is visible within the frame.
