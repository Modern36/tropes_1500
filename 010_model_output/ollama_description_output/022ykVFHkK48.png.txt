There appear to be no people visible in this photograph as it seems to show a floor plan for some kind of building or room layout. There are two black-and-white diagrams of different rooms, with various objects and features labeled throughout each diagram. The background of the image is white, providing a clean and neutral backdrop for the diagrams.

Given that there are no people visible in the photograph, it's not possible to identify their gender based on clothing or other visual cues. Therefore, I would refer to them as 'people' if they were present, but since they are not, I will simply state that there are no individuals depicted in this image.
