There are no people visible in this photograph. The image depicts a rural landscape with a dirt road or path running through it, flanked by stone walls on either side. In the distance, there appears to be a cluster of buildings, possibly houses or farm structures, but they are too far away to discern any details about their occupants.

The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a peaceful and serene setting, with no signs of human activity or presence in the foreground. The focus seems to be on capturing the natural beauty of the landscape rather than depicting people or their activities.
