There are no people visible in this photograph, but there is a horse standing in the woods next to what appears to be an old-fashioned carriage or cart. The image seems to have been taken during the daytime, possibly outdoors, and features trees and foliage in the background. There are also some items scattered on the ground near the horse that could potentially belong to people who were present at the time of the photo but are not currently visible.

**Key Observations:**

* No individuals are discernible within the frame.
* A horse is positioned beside a carriage or cart, suggesting human presence even if they are not directly shown.
* The setting appears to be outdoors during daylight hours.
* Trees and foliage serve as the backdrop for the scene.
* Items on the ground near the horse imply recent human activity.

**Conclusion:**

While there are no people visible in this photograph, the presence of a horse with what looks like a carriage or cart indicates that humans might have been involved at some point. The outdoor setting and scattered items further support this inference.
