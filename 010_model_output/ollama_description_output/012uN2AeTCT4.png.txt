There are no people visible in this photograph. The image appears to be a black-and-white picture of an empty shipyard or warehouse, with various pieces of equipment and machinery scattered throughout the space. 

The overall atmosphere of the image suggests that it was taken during a time when the facility was not actively being used, possibly due to maintenance or repairs.
