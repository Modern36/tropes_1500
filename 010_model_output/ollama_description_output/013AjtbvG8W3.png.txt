The photograph shows a vintage black-and-white image of a bride and groom on their wedding day. The woman has short hair and wears a long-sleeved dress with lace details, a veil covering her face, and carries a bouquet of flowers in front of her. She stands to the left of the man, who is dressed in a dark suit, white shirt, and bow tie.

In this image, there are only two people visible: the bride and groom. They appear to be adults, likely in their 20s or 30s, based on their attire and hairstyles typical of the time period depicted. The woman's clothing suggests that she is a bride, while the man's formal attire indicates that he is the groom.
