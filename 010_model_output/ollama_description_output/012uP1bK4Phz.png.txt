The photograph features a woman with short dark hair, dressed in a fur-trimmed coat and hat, posing for the camera while holding a fur muff. Her attire suggests she is from an upper-class background, possibly from the 1920s or 1930s.

In the background, there are no other people visible, as the focus of the image is solely on the woman. The setting appears to be a studio or indoor location, with a plain backdrop that does not provide any additional context about her surroundings.

Overall, the photograph presents a portrait of an elegantly dressed woman from a bygone era, showcasing her refined style and sophistication.
