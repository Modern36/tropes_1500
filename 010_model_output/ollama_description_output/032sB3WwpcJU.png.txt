The photograph depicts five individuals, all of whom appear to be men. They are dressed in formal attire, with three standing behind two seated individuals. The two seated men sit on either side of a small table adorned with a vase containing flowers and a decorative cloth.

In the background, there is no one visible beyond the main subjects. However, it's worth noting that the image has been cropped to focus solely on the five men in question.
