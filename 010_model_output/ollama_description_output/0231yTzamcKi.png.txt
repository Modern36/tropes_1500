The photograph appears to be a black-and-white image of a train station, with several individuals visible on the platform and surrounding area.

**Key Observations:**

*   **Platform Area:** There are approximately five people standing near the platform, although they are not clearly defined due to the distance from the camera. These figures do not appear large enough in relation to other objects or buildings around them, making it challenging to discern any specific details about their gender.
*   **Background Figures:** In the background of the image, there may be additional people present but they are too far away and indistinct for accurate identification or description.

**Conclusion:**

Given the limitations posed by the distance and resolution of the photograph, it is not possible to determine the gender of any individual depicted in this historical collection. As such, all figures captured within the scene can only be referred to as "people" without further specification regarding their sex.
