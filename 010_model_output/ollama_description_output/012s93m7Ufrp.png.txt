There are no people visible in this photograph. The image depicts a black-and-white scene of two wooden buildings, with one featuring an open doorway and the other having closed doors. The presence of a bench outside one of the buildings suggests that it may be used for sitting or resting.

In the background, there is a large tree on the left side of the image, which adds depth to the scene. However, despite the detailed setting, no individuals are present in the photograph.
