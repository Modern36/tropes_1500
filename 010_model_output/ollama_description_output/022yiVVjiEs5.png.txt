There are two men visible in this photograph, both wearing dark-colored jackets with collars. One man stands on a platform or scaffolding, facing away from the camera and towards an area where various tools and materials are scattered about. He has his hands resting on what appears to be a railing of some sort.

In the background, another man can be seen partially obscured by the structure that the first man is standing near. This second man is also wearing dark clothing and seems to be engaged in work or inspection activities, although it's difficult to discern exactly what he is doing due to his position relative to other objects in the scene.

Both individuals appear to be adults based on their stature and attire, which suggests they are likely involved in construction, maintenance, or similar tasks given the context of their surroundings.
