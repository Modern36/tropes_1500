The photograph shows a solitary man standing outside a building with a sign reading "JARNBROTT". He is attired in dark clothing, including a suit jacket, trousers, and shoes, and wears a cap on his head. His hands are tucked into his pockets.

In the background, there appears to be a window on the left side of the image, although it is not clearly visible due to the low resolution of the photograph. The overall atmosphere suggests that the man may be waiting for something or someone, possibly at a train station given the presence of the sign and the formal attire he wears.
