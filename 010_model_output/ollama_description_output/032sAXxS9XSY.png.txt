There are no people visible in this photograph. The image appears to be an aerial view of a church or other religious building, with surrounding fields and trees. There is no indication of any human presence in the scene.

The subject matter seems to focus on the architecture and landscape rather than individuals. Therefore, without any visible persons, it's not possible to determine their gender based on clothing or any other characteristic.
