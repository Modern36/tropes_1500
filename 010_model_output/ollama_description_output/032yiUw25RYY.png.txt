The photograph depicts a single person, a woman, who is sitting on the grassy ground next to some bushes or trees. She has dark hair pulled back into a bun and is wearing what appears to be a light-colored dress with short sleeves that are rolled up. The dress also features a belt at the waist.

In front of her lies a white blanket or sheet, which may have been used for a picnic. On this blanket, there is a small basket, possibly made of wicker or straw, containing food and drinks. A thermos bottle is visible next to the basket.

The woman is engaged in eating an apple, holding it in her right hand while looking directly at the camera with a slight smile on her face. Her left arm rests on her lap, adding to the relaxed atmosphere of the scene.

To her right, another person's leg can be seen extending from behind the bushes or trees. This individual is not fully visible but appears to be wearing dark pants and has their foot resting on the ground near the blanket.

Overall, the image captures a serene moment of leisure and enjoyment in a natural setting, with the woman as the main subject surrounded by subtle hints of companionship and outdoor activities.
