There are no individuals visible in this photograph. The picture shows a pair of wheels, likely for a train or other rail vehicle, lying on the ground next to a set of tracks. A small wooden building stands behind the wheels, and another set of tracks runs along one side of the image. In the background, there is a grassy hill with trees visible through the foliage.
