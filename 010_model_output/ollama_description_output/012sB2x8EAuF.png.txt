The photograph depicts a woman standing alone in front of a plain backdrop.

She has short hair and is wearing a light-colored dress with long sleeves, accompanied by dark shoes. Her attire appears modest and formal for the time period, suggesting that this may be a professional or studio portrait.

There are no other people visible in the background or anywhere else within the frame of the photograph. The focus is solely on the woman, who stands centrally positioned against the neutral backdrop.
