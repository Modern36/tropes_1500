The image depicts a single person, who appears to be an adult male. He is dressed in attire typical of early 20th-century farming or laboring activities, including overalls and a hat. The man's gender can be inferred from his clothing style, which was more commonly associated with men during that period.

In the background, there are no other individuals visible. The focus of the image is on the solitary figure in the foreground, engaged in some form of manual labor or agricultural activity. There are no people partially hidden by objects or out of focus in the photograph.
