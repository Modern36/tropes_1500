The photograph features a person prominently positioned on the left side, wearing a white shirt with an oval-shaped patch or badge on the front. The individual's attire suggests they may be participating in some sort of event or activity.

In the background, there appears to be another person, although it is difficult to discern any distinct details about their gender due to being out of focus and partially obscured by other elements within the image.
