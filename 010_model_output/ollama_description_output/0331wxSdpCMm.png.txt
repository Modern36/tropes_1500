The photograph shows a group of workers on a construction site. They are dressed in dark suits, hats, and coats which were typical attire for men during this period. There does not appear to be any women or children visible in the image.

There appears to be 6 people in total. The individuals are standing around what seems to be some sort of equipment or machinery, possibly related to their work on the construction site. They seem engaged and focused on their tasks, with one person pointing at something off-camera while another looks down intently. Another man stands slightly apart from the others, observing them with interest.

In the background, there appears to be other structures or buildings under construction, but these details are not clearly visible due to the distance and quality of the image. Overall, the photograph captures a moment in time when workers were actively involved in building something new, likely contributing to urban development during that era.
