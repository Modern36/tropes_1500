The image shows a black-and-white photograph of a lake scene with two people standing on the shore. The people are located at the center left of the picture, near the water's edge.

There appears to be one male and one female. The man is wearing dark pants and a light-colored shirt, while the woman has on a long dress that reaches down to her ankles. They both have their backs turned towards the camera as they gaze out across the lake.

In addition to these two individuals, there are no other people visible in the background or foreground of the photograph.
