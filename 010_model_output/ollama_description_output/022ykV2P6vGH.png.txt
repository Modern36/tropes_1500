There do not appear to be any people visible in this image. The photograph appears to show a rural landscape or village from an aerial perspective, with several buildings and what looks like a body of water in the foreground. There are no discernible human figures within the frame.

The only indication of potential habitation is the presence of structures that resemble houses or buildings, but without any clear signs of people, it's impossible to determine if anyone is present in the scene. The focus seems to be on capturing the layout and geography of the area rather than depicting individuals.
