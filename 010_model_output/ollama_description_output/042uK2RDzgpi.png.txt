There are no people visible in this photograph. The image appears to be a black-and-white picture of a river or stream with rapids, possibly taken from an old collection. The water is white and foamy, indicating strong currents. In the background, there are trees and hills on both sides of the river, suggesting a rural or natural setting.

The overall atmosphere of the image suggests that it was taken during the daytime, likely in the early 20th century given its black-and-white format. However, without any people present, it's impossible to determine their gender based solely on clothing as there are no individuals depicted in the photograph.
