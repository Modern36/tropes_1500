The black-and-white photograph depicts a rocky cliff face with a large piece of machinery situated at its base. The machine features a long boom extending upwards, which appears to be attached to a pulley system or cable.

In the foreground, several individuals are visible:

*   A man wearing a hat and jacket is standing on the left side of the image, near the base of the cliff.
*   Another individual, possibly a woman due to her attire, is positioned behind the man. Her face is not clearly visible.
*   Two additional people can be seen in the background, one of whom may be a child. However, their features are indistinct due to the distance and quality of the photograph.

It is challenging to determine the exact number of individuals present in the image with certainty, as some figures blend into the surroundings or are partially obscured by other objects. Nevertheless, it appears that there are at least five people visible in the scene.
