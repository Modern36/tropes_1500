There are no individuals visible in this photograph. The image depicts a large white building with numerous windows, set against a backdrop of trees and a clear sky. In the foreground, there is a street or sidewalk that appears empty of people.

Given the absence of any discernible figures within the scene, it is not possible to identify gender distinctions among individuals based on their clothing or other visual cues. The photograph primarily focuses on capturing the architectural features of the building and its surroundings rather than depicting human subjects.
