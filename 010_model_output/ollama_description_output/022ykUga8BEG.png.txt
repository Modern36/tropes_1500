The photograph shows a black-and-white photo of men playing football on an open field with a goalpost at each end. The players are wearing shorts and shirts from two different teams, one team dressed in dark-colored kit and the other in light-colored kits.

In the background, there is a crowd of people watching the game. They appear to be standing behind a fence or barrier that separates them from the field. Some spectators are visible in the stands, but they are not clearly defined due to the distance and quality of the image.

There do not appear to be any women or children present in the photograph. The focus is primarily on the men playing football, with no other individuals visible in the foreground or background.
