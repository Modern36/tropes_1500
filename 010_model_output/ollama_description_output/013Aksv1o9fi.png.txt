There are no people visible in this photograph. The image appears to be a close-up of an architectural structure, possibly part of a building or monument, with a focus on its stone or brickwork and ornamental details such as carvings or statues. The absence of any figures suggests that the primary subject is the architecture itself rather than human activity or presence.

Since there are no individuals present in the image, it's not possible to describe their gender based on clothing or other attributes. The photograph seems intended to highlight the architectural features and craftsmanship of the structure depicted, without including people as part of its composition.
