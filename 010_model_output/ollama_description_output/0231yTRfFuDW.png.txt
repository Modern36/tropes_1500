The photograph is a black-and-white image of an old train with several men standing on it, accompanied by other men standing alongside the tracks.

In the foreground, there are approximately 20 individuals visible in the image. All of them appear to be adult males, distinguished by their attire and hairstyles typical of the late 19th or early 20th century. They are dressed in suits, hats, and coats, which were common clothing items for men during that era.

The majority of these people are standing on the train itself, while a few others can be seen walking along the tracks nearby. Some individuals are partially obscured by trees or other objects in the background, but based on their clothing and overall appearance, it is likely that they too are adult males.

In summary, all the people visible in this image appear to be adult men, as indicated by their distinctive clothing and hairstyles characteristic of the late 19th or early 20th century.
