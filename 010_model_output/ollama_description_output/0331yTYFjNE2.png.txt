The image depicts a black-and-white photograph of an old city square, with several buildings and streets visible. In the foreground, there are no people present. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that some individuals may be standing in front of one of the buildings or walking down the street.

Unfortunately, due to the low resolution and grainy quality of the image, it is challenging to discern any details about these potential figures. They appear as small, blurry shapes without distinct features such as facial expressions or clothing. As a result, it is impossible to determine their gender or age with certainty.

In conclusion, while there may be people present in this historical photograph, they are too faint and indistinct to provide any meaningful information about them.
