The photograph portrays a line-up of soldiers on parade. They are all wearing military uniforms with hats and boots; some of them wear jackets and others wear tunics. There appear to be no women in the image, as none of the people pictured have any discernible female features or feminine clothing.

In the background is another group of soldiers standing at attention. On the far right-hand side of the photograph stands a large building that appears to be made from wood; it has multiple windows and a sloping roof. The ground in the foreground and mid-ground is flat, with no visible vegetation. In the distance behind the soldiers are trees.

The overall atmosphere suggests an official military event or ceremony, possibly a training exercise or inspection.
