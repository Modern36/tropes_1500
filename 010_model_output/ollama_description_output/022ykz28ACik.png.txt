The image depicts two people standing in front of a house, with one person positioned slightly behind the other. The individual closer to the viewer appears to be wearing a long coat or dress, which suggests they might be female. However, it's challenging to confirm this due to the low resolution and lack of clear facial features.

In contrast, the person partially obscured by foliage seems to have short hair, typically associated with men during that time period. Yet, without more distinct details about their attire or facial structure, it remains uncertain whether they are male or female.

The background of the photograph is dominated by trees and bushes, which could potentially conceal additional individuals who are not readily visible due to the foliage. Given the era in which the photo was taken (late 19th or early 20th century), clothing styles were more formal, but gender-specific attire was less pronounced than today.

Considering these factors, it's difficult to definitively identify the genders of the people in the photograph without making assumptions based on limited visual cues. Therefore, it would be most accurate to refer to them as "people" rather than assigning specific genders.
