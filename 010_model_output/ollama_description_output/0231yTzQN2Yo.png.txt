There are no people visible in this photograph. The image depicts a serene scene of a house surrounded by trees and bushes, with a fence running along the front of the property. In the background, there appears to be a road or path leading up to the house, but it is not clear if anyone is present on it.

The overall atmosphere of the photograph suggests a peaceful and idyllic setting, with no signs of human activity or presence. The focus of the image seems to be on the natural surroundings and the architecture of the house itself, rather than on any individuals who may have been present at the time the photo was taken.
