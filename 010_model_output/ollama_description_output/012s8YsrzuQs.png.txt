There are two people visible in this photograph.

The person on the left appears to be a young boy with short blonde hair. He is wearing shorts and a short-sleeved shirt, and is standing next to an object that could be a cooler or ice box which has wheels at one end but no handles. The boy is facing towards his right, where there is another person.

The other person in the image appears to be slightly older than the first person, and their hair cannot be seen as they are looking down. They appear to be wearing dark shorts with a white shirt that may have long sleeves, and are holding something (perhaps food) up to their mouth or face. This person is also facing towards their right.

In the background there appears to be grassy land with small trees and bushes. A dirt road is visible on the left side of the image, and there is a car parked next to it. There do not appear to be any people in the background of this photograph.
