There are no people visible in this photograph.

The image depicts a model ship with three masts and billowing sails, set against a plain background. The ship is positioned centrally in the frame, with its bow facing slightly to the left. The sails are white and appear to be made of a lightweight material, possibly cotton or silk. They are attached to the masts using ropes and pulleys, which add texture and depth to the image.

In the background, there is a subtle gradient that suggests a sky or sea horizon. However, it is not possible to determine whether the ship is at sea or in port, as there are no other objects or landmarks visible in the distance.

Overall, the photograph presents a serene and peaceful scene, with the model ship being the main focus of attention. The lack of people in the image adds to its sense of calmness and tranquility, inviting the viewer to appreciate the beauty of the ship's design and craftsmanship.
