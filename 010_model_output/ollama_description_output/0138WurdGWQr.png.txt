The photograph presents a black-and-white portrait of a bride and groom on their wedding day. The couple stands side-by-side, gazing directly at the camera.

The woman has short hair with finger waves and wears a veil that covers her face, extending down to her shoulders. Her dress features lace sleeves and embellishments around the neckline, accompanied by a floral bouquet in her right hand. She accessorizes with pearl earrings and holds a white glove in her left hand, while resting her right arm on the man's shoulder.

The man wears a dark suit, complete with a bow tie and a carnation pinned to his lapel. He has short hair and stands behind a small table adorned with flowers. The background of the image is indistinct but appears to be a studio setting with curtains or drapes.
