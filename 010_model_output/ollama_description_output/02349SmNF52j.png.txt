The image depicts a baby lying in a coffin, with no other individuals visible. The baby is dressed in white clothing and appears to be resting on a pillow or cushion within the coffin. There are flowers placed around the baby's head.

In the background, there are some indistinct objects that may include vases of flowers or other decorative items, but they are not clearly visible due to the focus being primarily on the baby in the foreground.
