The photograph appears to show two vessels on a body of water, with no people visible in the image. 

There is no discernible detail of any individuals within the image. The boats seem relatively small and there are no figures or silhouettes that would suggest human presence onboard either vessel.

Due to the lack of clarity or visibility of any person in the photograph, it is impossible to determine if they are men, women, children, or a mix thereof based solely on this image.
