There are two individuals visible in this photograph. The first person appears to be a man wearing dark-colored pants and a light shirt with long sleeves, standing on the train tracks underneath the bridge. He seems to be looking away from the camera, towards an object that is not shown in the photo.

The second individual is also likely a man, dressed similarly to the first, but facing the opposite direction. This person appears to be walking away from the photographer and is located further along the tracks under the bridge.

It's worth noting that these individuals are quite small compared to the main focus of the image, which is the train tracks and surrounding environment. Therefore, it can only be assumed based on their clothing what gender they may be, as it is not possible to discern any facial features or other distinguishing characteristics.
