There is one person visible in this photograph. They appear to be a man dressed in dark attire, likely a suit, with his hands clasped together in front of him. He stands at the bottom of wooden steps leading up to what seems to be the entrance of a cabin or house. The image quality makes it challenging to discern finer details about his appearance beyond his gender and clothing.

In the background, there are no other individuals visible. The focus is primarily on the structure in the foreground, with the surrounding environment being somewhat obscured by trees and foliage. Therefore, based on the information provided by the image, there is only one person present, who appears to be a man standing near an entranceway.
