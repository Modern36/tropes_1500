There are no people visible in this photograph. The image appears to be an aerial view of a rural landscape, with fields and forests stretching out as far as the eye can see. There are no signs of human activity or presence anywhere in the picture.

It's worth noting that the lack of people in the image could suggest that it was taken at a time when the area was relatively uninhabited or undeveloped. Alternatively, it's possible that the photographer intentionally avoided capturing any people in the shot, focusing instead on showcasing the natural beauty of the landscape.

Overall, while there may not be any people visible in this photograph, it still provides a fascinating glimpse into the past and offers insights into the history and development of the area depicted.
