The image shows a black-and-white portrait of a man dressed in formal attire, sitting for the camera. The subject is a white male with short hair slicked back, wearing a dark suit jacket over a crisp white shirt and patterned tie. He sits on a chair, facing slightly to his right, with his left elbow resting on the armrest and his hand supporting his head. His gaze is directed at the viewer.

In the background, there is a plain backdrop that appears to be a painted canvas or paper screen, which suggests this photo was taken in a studio setting for professional purposes such as an official portrait or publicity shot. The overall atmosphere of the image conveys seriousness and formality, typical of portraits from earlier eras where subjects often maintained solemn expressions during photography sessions.

There are no other people visible in the photograph beyond the main subject.
