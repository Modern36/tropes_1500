There do not appear to be any people visible in this photograph. The image appears to show a horse-drawn carriage with two horses attached to it, but there is no one driving the carriage or riding in it. There also does not appear to be anyone standing around the carriage or in the background of the image.

It's worth noting that the quality of the photograph is quite poor, which may make it difficult to determine whether there are any people present. However, based on a careful examination of the image, I could not find any evidence of human figures.
