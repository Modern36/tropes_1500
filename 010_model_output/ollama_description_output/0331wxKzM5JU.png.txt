There do not appear to be any people visible in this image. The image shows a small house or cottage surrounded by trees and foliage, with no signs of human presence. The photograph appears to be an old black-and-white print, which may have been taken many years ago. It is possible that the photographer intentionally avoided including people in the shot, focusing instead on capturing the natural beauty of the scene. Alternatively, it could simply be a coincidence that there are no people visible in the image.
