The photograph depicts a group of children posing on the steps of a building. The children are all dressed in casual attire, with some wearing shorts and t-shirts, while others wear dresses or skirts. There appears to be no adults present in the image.

In terms of gender identification, it is possible to make some educated guesses based on traditional clothing norms for men and women during that time period. However, it's important to note that these are just assumptions and may not accurately reflect the individuals' true genders.

Assuming traditional gender roles were followed at that time, we can observe that most of the children in the front row appear to be boys, as they wear shorts and have short haircuts. On the other hand, some of the girls in the back rows seem to be wearing dresses or skirts, which were more common attire for young girls during that era.

It's also worth noting that there may be individuals who do not conform to these traditional gender norms, and it would be inappropriate to make assumptions about their gender based solely on appearance. Ultimately, without additional context or information, it is impossible to determine the genders of everyone in this photograph with certainty.
