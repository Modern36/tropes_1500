In this historical photograph, there appears to be one man in the foreground and another farther back. 

The man in the foreground stands with his back to the camera, wearing a dark beret, long-sleeved jacket, trousers, and boots that are typical of military attire during World War I. He holds a rifle at an angle across his right shoulder, with the barrel pointing upwards and slightly towards his left side.

In the background, there is another man who seems to be walking away from the camera, but only his legs and lower torso are visible due to him being partially obscured by the foreground figure. This individual also wears long trousers and boots similar to those worn by the first man.

There do not appear to be any women or children in this photograph.
