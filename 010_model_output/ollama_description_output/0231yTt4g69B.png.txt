The photograph shows a black-and-white scene of a train station with a single person standing on the platform. The individual is wearing dark pants and a light-colored shirt, but their face is not clearly visible due to the distance from the camera.

In the background, there are no other people visible in the image. The focus appears to be on the train station itself rather than any individuals present at the time of capture.

Overall, based on this photograph, it can be concluded that only one person is depicted - a male figure standing alone on the platform without any discernible features or expressions due to the distance from the lens.
