The photograph depicts a single person standing in front of a building, but unfortunately, it is too blurry to determine any distinguishing features or clothing that would allow for an accurate identification of gender. The image does not provide enough clarity to make out details such as facial structure, hair style, or attire, which are commonly used indicators for determining whether someone is male or female.

Given the lack of clear visual cues and the poor quality of the photograph, it is impossible to definitively categorize the individual in the picture based on gender. Therefore, referring to them simply as a "person" is the most appropriate choice without making assumptions that could be inaccurate.
