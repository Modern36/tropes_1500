The photograph features three young girls posing together for a photo.

In the foreground, there are two girls standing behind another girl who is seated on a chair. The girl sitting down has short blonde hair and is wearing a dark dress with a light-colored collar and buttons down the front. She has her hands clasped together in her lap. Behind her to the left stands a girl with short, wavy blonde hair. She is wearing a dark dress with a white collar and a bow at the neck. Her right hand rests on the shoulder of the seated girl. On the other side of the seated girl stands another girl with short, straight blonde hair. She is also dressed in a dark dress with a light-colored collar and buttons down the front.

All three girls appear to be between 10-14 years old. They are all looking directly at the camera with neutral expressions on their faces. The background of the image is a plain wall or backdrop, which suggests that this may have been taken in a studio setting. Overall, the photograph captures a moment of innocence and simplicity from a bygone era.
