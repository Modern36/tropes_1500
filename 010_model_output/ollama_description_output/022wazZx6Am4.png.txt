The photograph shows a single person standing next to a large cannon. The individual is dressed in dark attire, which makes it challenging to discern any distinct features or accessories. However, based on the overall appearance and context of the image, it appears that this person is likely an adult male.

There are no other individuals visible in the background or foreground of the photograph. The focus seems to be primarily on the cannon and the solitary figure accompanying it. Given the absence of additional people, there is no opportunity to compare clothing styles or make gender distinctions beyond what can be inferred from the sole individual present.
