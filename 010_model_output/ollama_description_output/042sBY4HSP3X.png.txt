This photograph depicts a family posing on a grassy lawn in front of a house.

The three adults appear to be a man and two women. The woman on the left appears older than the others, while the younger woman holds an infant. In front of them are five children standing or sitting on the ground.

In the background stands a traditional Swedish wooden farmhouse with a tiled roof. To its right is a barn. A row of trees separates these buildings from the road that runs along the edge of the image. On the left, there appears to be another building in the distance. The grassy lawn stretches out before them and a flagpole rises behind the group.

The family seems to have gathered for a photograph on a sunny day; their shadows are cast onto the ground around them.
