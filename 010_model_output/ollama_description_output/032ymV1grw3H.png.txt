The photograph depicts a group of approximately 20 individuals standing together at the edge of a body of water, with waves breaking behind them.

In terms of gender, it appears that all the individuals in the image are children, likely boys and girls, who seem to be enjoying themselves in the water. Notably, none of the figures wear distinctive clothing that would indicate their gender. Unfortunately, due to the lack of visible facial features and other identifying characteristics, it is impossible to determine with certainty whether any of these individuals are specifically men, women or children.

In the background, there appears to be a person standing further back from the main group, although they are not clearly visible due to being out of focus. The presence of this additional figure suggests that there may be other people in the surrounding area who are not immediately apparent.

Overall, while we can make some educated guesses about the composition of the group based on their attire and behavior, it is important to acknowledge that our understanding of the individuals in the image is limited by the available information.
