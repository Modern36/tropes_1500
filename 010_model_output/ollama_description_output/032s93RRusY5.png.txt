There are no people visible in this photograph. The image depicts a woman standing next to a table with various items on it, including vases of flowers and what appears to be a framed picture or certificate. However, there is no one else present in the scene.

The woman herself is not clearly defined as male or female based solely on her clothing, but given the context and historical period suggested by the decor and attire, it can be inferred that she is likely an adult female. Her dress style and hairstyle are consistent with those commonly worn by women during the mid-20th century when this photo was taken.

In summary, while there are no other individuals visible in the background or anywhere else within the frame of the photograph, the single person depicted is most probably a woman based on her attire and the era represented.
