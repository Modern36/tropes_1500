The photograph depicts a scene with several individuals present, but it is challenging to accurately determine the gender or other specific details about each person due to the black-and-white nature of the image and its age. The people in the foreground appear to be men, as suggested by their attire and hairstyles typical of that era. However, without color or clearer resolution, it's difficult to make definitive conclusions about gender based solely on clothing.

In the background, there are more individuals who seem to be watching an event unfold. These figures are less distinct due to being further away from the camera and possibly out of focus, making it even harder to discern any personal characteristics such as age or gender. Given these limitations, referring to all individuals in the image as "people" is appropriate since specific details cannot be reliably determined.

Overall, while the photograph offers a glimpse into a historical moment, the lack of clarity and color hinders detailed analysis of the people depicted beyond general observations about their presence and apparent interest in the event captured.
