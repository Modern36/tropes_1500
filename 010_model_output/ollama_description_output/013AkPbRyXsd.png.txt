The photograph is a black-and-white image of a group of children posing for a class photo.

There are 18 children visible in the photograph, arranged into three rows. The back row consists of seven boys standing behind one another, with all wearing long-sleeved shirts and ties. The middle row comprises five girls seated on chairs, each dressed in pinafores or smocks over their dresses. Two additional boys sit in the front row, also wearing long-sleeved shirts and ties.

In the background, there is a wall adorned with two windows featuring curtains. To the left of the children stands an adult male figure, partially obscured by the edge of the image. He wears a suit jacket, white shirt, and tie.
