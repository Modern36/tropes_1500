The photograph depicts a single person crouched down examining rock paintings on the side of a cliff face.

He appears to be wearing traditional Sami clothing including a dark woolen coat with a wide belt and a hat, and he has his hands up against the rock wall as if he is touching or closely inspecting the painting. There are no other people visible in the image.
