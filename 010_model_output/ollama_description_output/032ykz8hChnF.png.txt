The photograph appears to show a crowd of mostly children in formal outfits, as well as adults dressed in 1920s-era attire, walking down a street lined with trees.

In the foreground, there are numerous children. Most of them appear to be boys due to their short hair and suits. They are all wearing hats, and many are holding canes or bouquets of flowers. Behind these younger figures, there is another group of people who seem slightly older; they may be teenagers based on their height relative to other individuals present within this scene.

In the background, there are several adults visible along both sides of the street. These individuals appear to be watching over the children as they walk by. Some of them seem engaged in conversation with one another while others simply stand observing what's happening before them without any apparent interaction amongst themselves at all during that moment captured forever within our view here today through photography alone (since no sound accompanies these images).
