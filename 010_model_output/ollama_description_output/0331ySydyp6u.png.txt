There do not appear to be any people visible in this photograph. The image features a large crane or hoist in the foreground, with what appears to be a train station or warehouse in the background. However, there are no individuals present in the scene.

It's worth noting that the photograph may have been taken at a time when people were not allowed to be photographed in certain areas or settings, which could explain their absence from the image. Alternatively, it's possible that the photographer intentionally avoided capturing people in the shot, focusing instead on the industrial equipment and architecture.
