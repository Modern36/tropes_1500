The photograph shows a man and woman sitting together on what appears to be a couch.

The woman sits with her hands folded in her lap, wearing a white sweater featuring intricate black embroidery. Her blonde hair is styled in a neat updo. The man's head rests gently against the back of the couch behind him as he looks straight ahead. He wears a dark suit jacket and light-colored shirt.

They are positioned to the left side of the image, with the woman slightly closer to the camera than the man. A small table sits between them, covered in books, papers, pens and paper clips, and what appears to be a white mug on a saucer.

The background is out of focus but consists of a large window adorned with sheer curtains. The walls are painted a light color, with dark-colored picture frames hanging on either side of the window.
