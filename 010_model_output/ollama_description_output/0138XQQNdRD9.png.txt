The photograph shows a man standing beside a large bus parked on a street. The man is wearing a dark jacket with what appears to be a pocket watch or other device attached to his waistcoat, and he has a hat and gloves.

There are several people in the background of the photo, but they are not clearly visible due to being out of focus. However, it appears that there may be two women standing near the bus, one wearing a long dress with what looks like an apron and another wearing something similar. They appear to have their hands on their hips or holding something up.

In addition to these individuals, there are several other people visible in the distance along the street. These figures are too small and blurry to make out any distinguishing features or clothing details.

Overall, based on the limited information available from the photograph, it is difficult to determine the exact number of men, women, or children present, as many of them are either partially hidden or too far away to discern clearly.
