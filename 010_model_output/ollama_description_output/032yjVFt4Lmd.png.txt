There appear to be three people visible in this photograph. A person on a bicycle can be seen in front of the building. It is impossible to determine any further details about this person from the photograph, as they are too far away and out of focus.

Two people stand on the steps at the entrance to the building. The person on the left appears to be wearing a hat, which suggests that it may be a man; however, it's not possible to say for certain. The other person is mostly obscured by the first person and so cannot be described in detail.

There are no children visible in this photograph.
