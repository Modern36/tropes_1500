The photograph shows a group of men sitting on steps outside a brick building. There are approximately 20 men visible, with most wearing work clothes consisting of overalls or jeans along with button-up shirts and hats. A few individuals wear jackets or sweaters, and several have pocket watches hanging from their necks.

In the background, the building appears to be made of red bricks and has a doorway or entrance that is not clearly defined. The steps leading up to the door are covered in dirt or debris, and there are some objects scattered around the area, such as tools or equipment.

Overall, the image suggests that these men may have been workers at a construction site or factory, possibly during the early 20th century based on their clothing and hairstyles.
