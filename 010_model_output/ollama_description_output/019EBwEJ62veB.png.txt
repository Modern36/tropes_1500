There are no individuals visible in this photograph. The image depicts a black-and-white scene with stairs on the right side, leading up to what appears to be a doorway or entrance. On the left side, there is a sign that reads "PARKETT HÖGER" and another sign below it that says "CIRKUS ORIENTAL." In front of these signs, several people are gathered, but they are not clearly visible due to the low resolution of the image.

In the background, more people can be seen standing around, although their faces are not discernible. The overall atmosphere suggests a public event or gathering, possibly related to the circus mentioned on one of the signs. However, without further context or higher-quality imagery, it is difficult to determine the exact nature of the occasion or identify any specific individuals present in the photograph.
