The image shows a black-and-white photograph of an older building with a grassy field in front. There appears to be some people standing on the sidewalk on the right-hand side of the photo, but they are very out-of-focus and difficult to see.

In the background of the picture there is a large building that spans most of the image. The building has three stories and is made of brick or stone. There are several windows visible in the image, as well as what appears to be a door on the ground floor.
