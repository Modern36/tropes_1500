This blurry black-and-white photograph depicts a man and woman standing outdoors on a winter's day. The woman stands at the left side of the image, her face obscured by the blur. Her dark dress reaches just below the knee; she wears stockings that can be seen above her dark shoes.

The man stands to the right of the woman, wearing a long-sleeved suit jacket and trousers. A hat obscures his face, but he appears to be smiling at the camera. The two people stand on what appears to be snow-covered grass in front of a house with a porch. The house is situated in the left-hand side of the image, partially obscured by a tree. In the background are two additional trees and another building that may be a garage or barn.
