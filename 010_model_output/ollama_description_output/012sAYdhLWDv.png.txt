The photograph features a group of 25 women standing together in front of a house. 

They appear to be dressed in long skirts or dresses with blouses and cardigans or jackets, typical of formal attire for women during the early to mid-20th century. Some wear hats, and several have flowers pinned to their chests. They are all barefoot.

The age range of these women appears diverse, spanning from young adulthood through middle age and possibly into older adulthood. There do not appear to be any children present in this photograph.
