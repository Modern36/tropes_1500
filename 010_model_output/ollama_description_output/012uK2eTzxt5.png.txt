The person featured in this photograph is a man wearing dark sunglasses and what appears to be swimming trunks or shorts. He is sitting in a kayak, holding a paddle in both hands. The man has short hair that could be considered blond, but the black-and-white image makes it difficult to determine with certainty.

In the background, there are no other people visible. However, there appear to be some trees along the shoreline, suggesting that the photograph was taken near a body of water such as a lake or river. The overall atmosphere of the image is one of relaxation and leisure, with the man enjoying his time on the water.
