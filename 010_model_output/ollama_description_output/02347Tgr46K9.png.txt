The photograph appears to depict two women posing for a portrait outdoors. One woman stands tall behind another who is crouching down on her knees.

Both women wear long dresses with short sleeves and have dark hair that falls just below their shoulders or ears. They are both smiling and looking directly at the camera, suggesting they were posing for this photograph rather than being caught in an unguarded moment. 

The woman standing behind wears a light-colored dress with a darker belt around her waist, while the other woman's dress is entirely dark-colored without any visible belt.

In the background of the image, there are trees and what looks like a house or building on the right side. The sky above them appears clear but slightly overcast, which could indicate that it was taken during the late afternoon or early evening when sunlight isn't as strong.
