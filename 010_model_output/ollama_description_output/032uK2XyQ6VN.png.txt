There are no people visible in this photograph. The image depicts a large, two-story house with a gable roof and chimney, surrounded by trees and a fence. In the foreground, there is a road or path leading up to the house, and a few buildings can be seen in the background. However, there are no individuals present in the scene.

It's worth noting that the photograph appears to be an old black-and-white image, which may have been taken during a time when photography was still a relatively new technology. As such, it's possible that the photographer focused on capturing the architecture and landscape rather than people.
