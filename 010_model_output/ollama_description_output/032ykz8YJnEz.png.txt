The photograph shows a man and woman standing together. The woman has short dark hair and is wearing a white blouse with a high neckline and long sleeves, a dark skirt that falls just below her knees, and dark shoes. She is also wearing a brooch on her left lapel and a ring on her right hand. The man has short light-colored hair and is wearing a dark suit jacket over a white shirt, a tie, dark pants, and dark shoes. He is also holding a hat in his right hand.

Both individuals appear to be adults, likely in their 20s or 30s, based on their facial features and attire. They are standing close together, with the woman slightly in front of the man, suggesting a romantic relationship or familial connection between them. The background of the photograph is out of focus, but it appears to be a studio setting with a plain backdrop.

Overall, the image presents a formal portrait of two individuals from an earlier time period, likely taken for personal or professional purposes.
