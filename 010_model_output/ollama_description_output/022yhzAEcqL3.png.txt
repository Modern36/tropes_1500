There appear to be six people in this photograph, but it is difficult to tell because they are either partially obscured or out of focus. 

In the foreground, there are three people lying on a beach towel, wearing bathing suits and caps. The person on the left appears to be female based on her swimsuit style. The two others beside her appear to be male, judging by their swim trunks.

Behind them in the background, there is a woman standing with her back facing the camera, wearing what looks like a light-colored dress or skirt that comes above her knees. To her left is a man who appears to be balding and wearing dark shorts and a white shirt. 

On the far right of the image, there are two people walking along the beach together - one is obscured by trees while the other has their back turned towards us so we cannot determine gender from this angle alone; however, both seem dressed casually likely for leisure activities outdoors given context clues such as location (beach) and attire choices made here today during summertime months when temperatures rise high enough outside making swimwear appropriate attire choice amongst many others available options depending upon personal preference etcetera.
