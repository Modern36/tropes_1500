The photograph depicts a scene with numerous individuals, but due to the black-and-white nature and low resolution of the image, it is challenging to discern specific details about each person's gender or age.

In the foreground, there are several people visible, although they appear somewhat blurry. It is difficult to determine their genders based on their clothing, as it seems to be traditional attire that does not provide clear indicators of gender. Some individuals wear hats, while others do not, which could potentially suggest differences in social status or occupation but does not necessarily indicate gender.

Behind the main group, there are additional people who are even less distinct due to being farther away from the camera and out of focus. These individuals appear as indistinct shapes without discernible features that would allow for an assessment of their genders.

Given the limitations imposed by the image's quality and the attire worn by the subjects, it is not possible to accurately determine the gender or age of any individual in the photograph with certainty. Therefore, referring to them collectively as "people" seems most appropriate under these circumstances.
