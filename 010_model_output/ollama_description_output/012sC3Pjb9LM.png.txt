There are two men visible in this photograph. One man stands on a platform above what appears to be an early printing press while another man stands with his hands on a machine to the left.

The man standing on the platform wears a dark suit, a light-coloured shirt and tie. The man on the left is dressed similarly but has a white collared shirt. Neither of their faces are visible in this image.
