The image depicts a man and woman standing together, with the man on the right side of the photo. The woman is dressed in a long-sleeved gown that appears to be made of satin or silk, featuring a high neckline and a full skirt that falls just below her knees. Her hair is styled in an updo, and she wears a pair of gloves that reach up to her elbows. In contrast, the man is attired in a tuxedo with a bow tie, complemented by a boutonniere on his left lapel.

Both individuals are positioned facing forward, with their bodies angled slightly towards each other. The woman's right hand rests on the man's left arm, while her left hand holds a bouquet of flowers. The man's hands are placed at his sides, with his left hand partially obscured by the woman's body.

In the background, there is no discernible setting or environment visible behind the couple. The overall atmosphere suggests that this photograph was taken during a formal event, such as a wedding or prom, given their attire and pose.
