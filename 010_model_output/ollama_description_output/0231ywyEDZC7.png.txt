The image shows a black-and-white photograph of railroad tracks being constructed. There appear to be five men standing around the rails, three on the left side and two on the right. The man furthest to the left wears a long coat with a wide lapel and appears to have his hands in the pockets of it; he also seems to wear a hat. To his right is another man wearing a vest over a collared shirt. He has a dark tie or scarf around his neck. The third man on this side wears a suit jacket, white shirt, and what appears to be a bowtie. On the other side of the tracks are two men in hats and coats; one also wears gloves. There is another person wearing a hat, standing behind them. The people appear to be engaged in construction work, as there are railroad ties stacked along the left-hand side of the tracks.
