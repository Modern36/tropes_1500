The photograph shows a black and white portrait of a man dressed in formal attire from the early 1900s. He wears a suit jacket with a high collar, a vest, a tie, and trousers. His hair appears to be dark and slightly greased back. The background is dark and indistinct, but it seems to be an indoor setting.

There are no other people visible in the photograph.
