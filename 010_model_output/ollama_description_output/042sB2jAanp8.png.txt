The photograph shows a man and woman in wedding attire.

In the foreground, there is a woman on the left side of the image, wearing a white dress with a veil over her head and holding a bouquet of flowers. She has dark hair styled in an updo. On the right side of the image, there is a man dressed in a black tuxedo with a bow tie and a boutonniere on his lapel. He has short, light-colored hair.

The woman's face is blurred, but her expression appears to be serious or solemn. The man's facial features are also indistinct due to the blurriness of the image; however, he seems to have a neutral or slightly smiling expression.

There do not appear to be any other people visible in this photograph beyond the bride and groom.
