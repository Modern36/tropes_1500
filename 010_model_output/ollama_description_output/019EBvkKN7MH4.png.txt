The photograph depicts four women standing together, posing for the camera. They are dressed in attire typical of the mid-20th century, with each woman wearing a dress and heels. The dresses vary in style but share similarities in design and fabric choice.

In the background, there is a field or meadow visible behind the women. Trees can be seen at the edge of this open area, adding depth to the scene. Notably, there are no other individuals present in the image beyond these four women.
