The photograph appears to show a person walking along train tracks in front of what looks like an entrance to a mine or tunnel.

There is one person visible in the image; they appear to be wearing shorts and a dark-colored jacket, as well as shoes with thick soles. The person's features are difficult to discern due to the low resolution and quality of the photograph, but they seem to have short hair. It appears that this person could be either male or female.

There is no one else visible in the image; there do not appear to be any people in the background or out of focus.
