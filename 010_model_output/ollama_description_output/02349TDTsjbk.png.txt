There are no people visible in this photograph. The scene appears to be a rural setting with a greenhouse or conservatory, possibly from an earlier era given the style of the structures and the presence of horse-drawn transportation elements in some parts of the image. 

The absence of individuals allows for a focus on the architectural details and the natural surroundings without human subjects to interpret gender expressions through clothing or other visual cues.
