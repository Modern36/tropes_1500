The image depicts a painting of a nude woman sitting on a chair, with her back turned towards the viewer. The subject's face is not visible, making it impossible to determine their gender based on facial features.

**Clothing and Accessories:**

*   The woman is completely naked, without any clothing or accessories that could provide clues about her identity.
*   She sits on a simple wooden chair with no cushions or upholstery.

**Background and Setting:**

*   The background of the painting is a plain wall with no discernible patterns or textures.
*   There are no other people visible in the image, either in the foreground or background.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the information provided by the clothing and accessories, as well as the lack of facial features and background context, it can be inferred that the subject of this painting is a woman. However, without more explicit evidence, such as clothing or accessories typically associated with one gender over another, it cannot be definitively stated whether the person depicted is male or female. Therefore, based on the available information, I would describe the person in the image as a "person" rather than specifying their gender.
