There do not appear to be any people shown in this image. The photograph appears to show an aerial view of a landscape with roads and buildings, but no individuals are visible.

The absence of people in the image suggests that it may have been taken for purposes such as mapping, surveying, or monitoring infrastructure development rather than capturing human activity or portraits.
