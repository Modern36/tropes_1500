The photograph shows a group of boys posing for a class photo, with two men likely being the teachers or staff members.

In the front row, there are approximately 10 boys sitting on the floor, all wearing dark jackets and ties. Behind them, another 15 boys stand in three rows, also dressed in dark jackets and ties. The majority of the students appear to be between 12-14 years old.

To the left side of the back row, a man with a mustache stands out, likely one of the teachers or staff members. He is wearing a suit jacket and tie, setting him apart from the students.

On the far right side of the photo, another man can be seen, although he is partially obscured by the edge of the frame. Despite this, it is clear that he is not a student due to his position and attire.

The background of the image shows a large blackboard with chalk writing on it, indicating that this is likely a classroom setting. Overall, the photograph captures a moment in time from an educational institution during the 1930s.
