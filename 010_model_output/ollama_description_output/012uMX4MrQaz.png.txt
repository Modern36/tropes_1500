There appear to be two men on the bottom left side of the photograph working in a shipyard, likely building or repairing a boat. The man closest to the camera seems to be wearing a hat and light-colored shirt with rolled-up sleeves. He has his back turned toward the camera as he works with what appears to be wood planks. There is another person further away from the camera who is partially hidden behind a pile of wood. This person also appears to be a man, possibly wearing a dark-colored jacket or sweater over their clothes.

In the background, there are no other people visible in this black-and-white photograph due to its age and quality.
