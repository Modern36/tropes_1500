The photograph appears to be a black-and-white portrait of Queen Mary, the wife of King George V.

Queen Mary is standing on the left side of the picture, slightly facing the right. She wears an elaborate wedding dress with a long train flowing behind her, which extends beyond the frame and is not fully visible. Her dress also features puffed sleeves and a high neckline, adorned with pearls or other forms of jewelry. A veil covers her head and shoulders.

Queen Mary holds a bouquet in her left hand, while her right arm is not clearly visible due to the position of the image. She stands on a rug with intricate patterns, which adds to the overall sense of grandeur and luxury.

In the background, a table or cabinet can be seen against the wall on the right side of the picture, although its details are somewhat obscured by the lighting conditions. Overall, the photograph exudes an air of elegance and sophistication, capturing the essence of Queen Mary's wedding day in exquisite detail.
