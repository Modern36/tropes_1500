The image depicts a scene with numerous individuals, but it's challenging to discern their gender due to the black-and-white nature of the photograph and the fact that they are all wearing similar attire. The majority of the people appear to be men, as evidenced by their suits and hats, which were common male fashion items during the time period when the photo was taken.

In the foreground, there is a group of people standing in front of a building, with some of them facing towards the camera while others have their backs turned. The individuals in this group are dressed in formal attire, suggesting that they may be attending an event or gathering of some sort.

Behind this group, there appears to be another cluster of people who are partially obscured by the first group. These individuals seem to be engaged in conversation, with some gesturing towards each other. While it's difficult to determine their gender from this distance, they also appear to be dressed in formal clothing.

Further back in the image, there is a figure standing alone near what appears to be a doorway or entrance. This person is wearing a suit and hat, which suggests that they may be a man. However, without more context or information about the individual's attire, it's impossible to say for certain whether this person is male or female.

Overall, while there are several individuals visible in the image, only one of them can be confidently identified as male based on their clothing and appearance. The gender of the other people depicted cannot be determined with certainty due to the limitations of the photograph.
