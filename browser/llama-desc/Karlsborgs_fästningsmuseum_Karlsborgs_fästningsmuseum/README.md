There are no people visible in this photograph. The image depicts a military scene with various objects, but there are no individuals present.

**Key Objects:**

* A tent
* Military equipment (e.g., helmets, rifles)
* A sign or flag

**No People Visible:**

Despite the presence of these objects, which suggest a military context, there are no people visible in the image. This could be due to various reasons such as the focus being on the equipment rather than personnel or the scene being staged for illustrative purposes.
