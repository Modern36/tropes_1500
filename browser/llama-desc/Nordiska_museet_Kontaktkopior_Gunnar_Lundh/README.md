There are no individuals visible in this image. The photograph appears to be a page from an old catalog or document, featuring a table with columns labeled "1980" and numbers ranging from 2090 to 2127. Each row contains a unique number, accompanied by a small black-and-white photograph of what seems to be a train track or railroad infrastructure. Unfortunately, there are no people present in any of these photographs.
