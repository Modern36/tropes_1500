There does not appear to be any people visible in this image.

The photograph depicts a formal dining table with a white tablecloth, adorned with fine china, crystal glasses, and silverware. The centerpiece features a decorative vase or candelabra, surrounded by place settings for multiple individuals. In the background, there are dark curtains covering windows on either side of the room, which appears to be decorated in an elegant style.

However, despite the elaborate setting, no people are present at the table or elsewhere in the image.
