There are no individuals depicted in this photograph. The scene appears to be a black-and-white image of a lumber mill or logging operation, with piles of logs and what seems to be a train car filled with wood chips or sawdust. In the background, there's a large structure that could be part of the mill itself or storage facilities for lumber products. Given the context and content of the photograph, it doesn't contain any people.
