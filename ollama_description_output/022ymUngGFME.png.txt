The image does not depict any people, but rather a framed black-and-white drawing of a ship at sea. The frame is white with an ornate gold border, and it features a decorative design in each corner. The drawing itself shows a three-masted sailing ship with billowing sails, set against a backdrop of waves and sea spray.

In the foreground, there are no people visible in the image. However, it's possible that some individuals may be present on the ship or in the surrounding waters, but they are not discernible due to the distance or lack of detail.

The background of the image consists of the ocean and sky, with the horizon line visible in the distance. There are no people depicted in this area either.

Overall, while there may be some individuals present in the scene, none can be clearly identified as men, women, or children due to their absence from the image.
