There do not appear to be any visible people shown in this photograph. There are some objects in the image including a boat and a tower which could potentially hide people, but it cannot be determined whether they contain anyone or not.

The image depicts an old black-and-white photograph of a body of water with a few boats and structures in the background. The main focus appears to be on a large wooden tower situated near the center of the frame.
