The photograph depicts a man and woman standing together in front of trees with autumnal foliage. The man is dressed in formal attire, wearing a suit jacket, vest, tie, and hat, while holding a cane in his right hand. He has short hair and is clean-shaven.

The woman stands beside him, attired in a long coat or dress with a high neckline and a wide-brimmed hat adorned with flowers. Her hair appears to be styled up under the hat. She holds a purse in her left hand.

In the background, several people are visible but out of focus. On the far left, a person wearing dark clothing is partially obscured by a tree trunk. To their right, another individual stands near the edge of the frame, clad in light-colored attire and facing away from the camera. Behind them, a third person can be seen walking along the path, dressed in dark clothing.

The photograph captures the couple posing for a portrait, with the man's formal attire suggesting that it may have been taken on a special occasion such as their wedding day or anniversary. The presence of other people in the background adds context to the scene, indicating that it was likely taken in a public place like a park or garden.
