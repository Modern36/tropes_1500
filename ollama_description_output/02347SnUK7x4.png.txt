There is one person visible in the photograph, a man standing on the platform outside of the station building. He is wearing dark pants and a light-colored shirt with rolled-up sleeves, and has short hair.

He appears to be an adult male, likely in his 30s or 40s, but it's difficult to determine his exact age due to the quality of the image. The man is not posing for the camera and seems to be going about his daily business, possibly waiting for a train or conducting some other activity related to the station.

Overall, the presence of this single individual adds a sense of scale and human activity to the otherwise static scene of the train station.
