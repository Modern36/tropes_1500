There are two children in this photograph.

One child, a boy with short hair and bangs, sits on an ornate wooden chair on the left side of the image. He has his legs crossed at the ankles and wears dark pants, black leather lace-up boots, and a long-sleeved coat with a high collar. His hands are clasped together in front of him.

The other child, a girl with short hair and bangs, sits on the same chair to the boy's right, resting her head against the back of the chair. She wears dark pants, black leather lace-up boots, and a long-sleeved coat with a high collar. Her hands are clasped together in her lap.

The children both wear coats that appear to be made of wool or another thick fabric, which may indicate they are dressed for cold weather. The boy holds a doll between his legs; the doll is wearing a dress with short sleeves and has its arms at its sides.

Behind the chair, there appears to be another person sitting on what looks like a couch or sofa. This person's head is not visible in the photograph.
