There are no individuals visible in this photograph. The image depicts a narrow alleyway with wooden buildings on either side, featuring windows and doors. In the foreground, there is a pile of firewood or logs against one of the walls. The ground appears to be made of cobblestones or uneven stone paving.

In the background, another building can be seen at the end of the alleyway, although it is not clearly visible due to the distance and lighting conditions. There are no people present in the image, only buildings and objects such as firewood.
