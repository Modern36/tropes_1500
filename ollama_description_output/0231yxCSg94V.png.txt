The photograph depicts a scene with several individuals, but it is challenging to discern their gender due to the lack of clear facial features and attire details. However, based on the context and available information, I can provide some observations:

*   In the foreground, there are three people standing near the train tracks. Two of them appear to be men, as indicated by their clothing and hats. The third person is partially obscured by another individual, making it difficult to determine their gender.
*   Behind these individuals, a group of people can be seen walking towards the camera. It appears that most of them are men, although one or two may be women due to their dresses or skirts. However, this is not definitive and should be taken as an educated guess rather than a certainty.
*   Further in the background, there are additional figures visible through the trees and buildings. These individuals are too distant to make out any distinguishing features, so it is impossible to determine their gender.

In summary, while some people can be identified as men based on their clothing and hats, others remain ambiguous due to limited visibility or lack of clear facial features. It is essential to approach such identifications with caution and consider them speculative rather than definitive.
