The man's facial features are characterized by dark hair that is neatly combed back, revealing a prominent forehead. His eyes appear to be brown or possibly hazel, although this cannot be definitively determined due to the monochromatic nature of the photograph. A subtle smile plays on his lips, adding a touch of warmth to his overall demeanor.

In terms of physical attributes, the man has a slightly rounded face shape and a nose that is neither particularly large nor small. His eyebrows are well-defined but not overly prominent.
