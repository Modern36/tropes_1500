The photograph depicts a serene scene of a boat navigating through calm waters, with several individuals on board. In the foreground, four people are visible, all wearing dark-colored attire and white hats. Two of these individuals appear to be men, while the other two could be either men or women due to their indistinct features.

In the background, there is another person standing near the edge of the boat, but their gender cannot be determined with certainty. Additionally, a woman can be seen in the far distance, although her presence is faint and not clearly defined.

It's worth noting that the image quality may have deteriorated over time, making it challenging to discern certain details. Nevertheless, based on the available information, it appears that there are at least six people present in the photograph, with varying levels of clarity regarding their genders.
