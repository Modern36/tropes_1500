The image depicts a sepia-toned photograph of a street scene, with several individuals visible in various parts of the frame.

In the foreground, there are three people walking along the sidewalk on the right side of the road. The person closest to the camera appears to be wearing a long coat and hat, while the other two individuals are partially obscured by trees or other objects. It is difficult to determine their gender due to the distance and lack of clear details.

On the left side of the road, near the building with the sign "Bergsundet," there is another person standing outside what appears to be a shop or store. This individual is also wearing a long coat and hat, making it challenging to discern their gender.

In addition to these individuals, there are several others visible in the background, including people walking down the street, standing on corners, or sitting on benches. However, they are too far away or partially hidden by objects to make out any distinguishing features that would allow for gender identification.

Overall, while it is possible to identify some of the individuals in the photograph as being male based on their clothing and hairstyles, many others remain ambiguous due to the limitations of the image quality and distance.
