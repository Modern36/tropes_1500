The photo depicts two men dressed in ski gear standing side-by-side. They are wearing military-style uniforms with a badge on the chest area, and each has a pair of skis slung over his shoulder.

In the foreground, there appears to be one woman sitting at a table, possibly holding a tray or plate of food. Her face is partially obscured by the two men standing in front of her.

In the background, several other people can be seen, although they are not clearly visible due to the distance and quality of the image. It's difficult to determine their gender or any distinguishing features.
