The photograph depicts a young child, likely a girl, standing alone in front of a plain backdrop. The child has short blonde hair and is dressed in a white dress with a ruffled hem, paired with black Mary Jane shoes. She appears to be around two or three years old.

In the background, there are no other people visible. However, it's worth noting that the photographer may have deliberately focused on the child as the main subject of the image, potentially excluding any individuals who might have been present in the surrounding environment.

Overall, based on the available information and visual cues from the photograph, it can be inferred that the only person depicted is a young girl, likely between two to three years old.
