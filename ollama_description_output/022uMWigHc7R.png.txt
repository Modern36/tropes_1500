There are no people visible in this photograph. The image appears to be a black-and-white landscape or garden scene, possibly from an older era given its monochromatic nature and the style of the structures depicted. Without any human figures present, it's impossible to identify gender based on attire or other distinguishing features since there are simply no individuals shown within the frame.
