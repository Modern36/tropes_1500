There are five people in this photograph who appear to be men standing near a building. They seem to be having a conversation. The man closest to the camera is wearing a hat, which obscures his face from view. He has a dark coat with light-coloured cuffs and a light-coloured collar that may be a shirt. He appears to have a large belt or sash around his waist. The person next to him also wears a hat, but it is not as clear what he looks like because the image quality is lower than for other parts of this photograph.
