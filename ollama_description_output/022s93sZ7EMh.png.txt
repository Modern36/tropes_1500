There are no people visible in this photograph. The image features a still life arrangement of fruit, with sliced melons arranged on a plate or platter. The melon slices appear to be artfully arranged, possibly for display or presentation purposes.

The background of the image is dark and indistinct, suggesting that it may have been taken indoors or in a studio setting. There are no other objects or individuals visible in the photograph beyond the fruit arrangement.

Overall, the absence of people in this image suggests that it was intended to showcase the fruit itself rather than any human subjects.
