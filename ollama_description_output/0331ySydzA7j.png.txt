The photograph appears to show a railway construction site with no people visible. There may be one person standing on the bridge at the top of the image, however they cannot be seen clearly enough to be certain and so it is impossible to say whether this figure is male or female.

There are two other figures in the background, but these are too far away for any details about them to be made out. One appears to be standing on the left side of the bridge, while another may be walking along the tracks below. However, since they are so far away and out of focus it is impossible to determine anything about them.

Overall, there appear to be three people in this photograph but only one of these can be confirmed with any certainty.
