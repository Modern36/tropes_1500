There are no people visible in this photograph. The image depicts a formal dining table set with fine china and crystal glasses, but there are no individuals present at the table or in the surrounding area.

The absence of people suggests that the focus of the photograph is on the setting itself rather than any specific individuals. This could be due to various reasons such as the photographer's intention to capture the ambiance or decor without including human subjects, or perhaps the scene was staged for a particular purpose where the emphasis was not on portraying people.

Given the lack of visible persons in the image, it is impossible to determine their gender based on clothing or any other distinguishing features. Therefore, there is no information available regarding male, female, child, or person categorization within this specific photograph.
