The black and white photograph depicts a platform at a train station, with three individuals standing on it.

A woman dressed in attire typical of the 1950s stands on the left side of the platform, facing away from the viewer toward the front of a steam engine that has pulled up to the platform. She wears a long coat and hat. To her right is an older man with a balding head who wears a suit. He faces in the same direction as the woman, looking at the train.

The third person stands further back on the platform near the buildings behind them, partially obscured by shadows. This figure could be either male or female, but their features are too indistinct to determine their gender with certainty.

In the background of the image, there is a building that appears to be a station house or waiting room, as well as other structures and trees visible through the windows and doorway of this building. The overall atmosphere suggests a quiet moment at a rural train station during an era when steam engines were still in use.
