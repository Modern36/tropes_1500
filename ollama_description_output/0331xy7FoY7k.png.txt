The image depicts a black-and-white photograph of a train station, with two individuals standing outside the building. The person on the left is wearing dark pants and a light-colored shirt or jacket, while the person on the right appears to be dressed in lighter attire.

In the background, there are several other people visible, although they are not clearly defined due to the distance and lack of focus. It is difficult to determine their gender based solely on their clothing, as it is indistinct.

Overall, the photograph suggests that the train station was a bustling hub of activity during this time period, with multiple individuals present in the scene. However, without more context or information about the specific location and date of the photograph, it is challenging to provide further details about the people depicted.
