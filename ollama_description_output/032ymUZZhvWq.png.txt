The photograph depicts two women standing side-by-side in a wooded area. The woman on the left wears a dark dress with a light-colored apron and has her hair styled in an updo, while the woman on the right sports a lighter-colored dress with a darker apron and also wears her hair in an updo.

In the background, there are trees and bushes that appear to be out of focus. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a daytime setting, likely during the early 20th century given the style of clothing worn by the women.
