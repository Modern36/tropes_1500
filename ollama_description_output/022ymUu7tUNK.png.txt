The image depicts two young boys, likely brothers, posing for a formal portrait. The boy on the left has short hair and wears a dark-colored suit with a white shirt and bow tie. He stands slightly behind his brother, who is positioned in front of him.

The boy in front has longer hair than his sibling and also wears a dark-colored suit with a white shirt and bow tie. Both boys have their hands resting on the back of a chair or table, which is not fully visible in the frame.

In the background, there appears to be a plain wall or backdrop, but it's difficult to make out any details due to the low resolution of the image. There are no other people present in the photograph beyond the two boys.
