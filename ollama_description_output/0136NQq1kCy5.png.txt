The image depicts a black-and-white photograph of a man sitting on a chair, holding a pipe. He is dressed in formal attire, consisting of a suit jacket, vest, white shirt, and tie. The man has short hair and appears to be middle-aged.

In the background, there are no other people visible. However, it's worth noting that the photograph may have been taken at an event or gathering where others were present but not captured in the frame. Without additional context or information about the occasion, it is impossible to determine if anyone else was present during the photo shoot.
