There do not appear to be any people visible in this image, only buildings. 

The photograph seems to show a historical collection of buildings, with a large house or building on the left side of the image and several smaller structures on the right. The main building has a tiled roof and appears to be made of stone or brick, while the smaller structures appear to be made of wood or other materials. There are no people visible in the photograph, but there may have been some activity taking place at the time it was taken.

It's worth noting that the quality of the image is not high enough to make out any details about the people who might have been present when the photograph was taken. The image appears to be a historical document, and as such, it may have been taken for archival or research purposes rather than for artistic or aesthetic reasons.
