In this black-and-white photograph, a gazebo-like structure is adorned with flags and banners on its pillars. At least seven individuals can be seen in the image.

On the left side, two boys in dark suits and hats stand next to each other, while a woman in a light-colored dress sits on the steps behind them. Another man in a suit stands beside her. In the background, a figure is visible standing near a tree at the edge of the road.

The individuals' facial features are not clearly discernible due to the black-and-white nature of the image and their distance from the camera. However, based on their clothing, it can be inferred that they are likely men or boys, with the exception of the woman in the light-colored dress.
