The image presents a group of individuals gathered on a dock or beach, with boats visible in the background. The majority of the people are men, dressed in suits and hats, while some wear uniforms adorned with medals. A few women are also present, clad in dresses and hats.

In the foreground, several men stand facing each other, engaged in conversation. One man is attired in a dark suit and tie, while another wears a light-colored suit and no tie. Behind them, additional individuals can be seen standing or sitting on benches.

To the left of the image, a group of people are positioned near the water's edge, with some appearing to be involved in an activity related to the boats. On the right side, more people are visible, although they are partially obscured by objects in the foreground.

The background of the image features several boats moored at the dock or floating on the water. The overall atmosphere suggests a formal event or gathering, possibly during the early 20th century given the attire and style of the individuals depicted.
