The photograph depicts two men standing on a boat, engaged in an activity involving fishing nets. The individuals are attired in traditional sailor's garb, consisting of caps and jackets with buttons down the front. One man is holding onto the net while the other appears to be pulling it towards him.

In addition to these two central figures, there is another person visible in the background who seems to be observing their actions from a distance. This individual is not clearly defined due to being out of focus but can still be discerned as a separate entity within the scene.

Overall, the image presents a snapshot of everyday life for fishermen during this time period, capturing both the physical labor involved in their work and the social dynamics at play among those engaged in it.
