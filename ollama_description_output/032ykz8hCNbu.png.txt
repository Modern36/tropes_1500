The image shows a group of 25-30 people dressed in old-fashioned costumes posing for a photograph.

In the front row there are seven young girls sitting down wearing dresses with large skirts and bonnets, while behind them stand two rows of adults and children, including men, women and boys, who appear to be parents or chaperones. The adults are all formally dressed in suits, hats and bonnets while the boys wear short jackets.

The clothing appears to be from the mid-19th century, judging by the large skirts worn by the girls and the style of the menswear including top hats and tailcoats with waistcoats and cravats. The people are arranged in a formal group photo and appear relaxed and happy, some of them smiling at the camera.

In addition to the main group there is one child sitting on the floor in front of the group who is out of focus and wearing what appears to be a dress. There is also part of another person visible at the bottom left corner of the image. 

It is not possible to say whether any of the people are wearing wigs or makeup as they appear to have natural hair and no obvious cosmetics.
