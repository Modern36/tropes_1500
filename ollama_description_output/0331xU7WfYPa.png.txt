The photograph depicts a single person, who appears to be a man dressed in military attire. He is wearing a helmet and holding what seems to be a rifle or another long object.

In the background, there are no other individuals visible within the frame of the image. The focus remains solely on the central figure, with no discernible people or objects that could potentially represent humans in the surrounding environment.
