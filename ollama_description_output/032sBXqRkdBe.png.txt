The photograph shows a group of approximately 25 children, both boys and girls, posing for a picture with two adults. The children appear to be dressed in casual attire typical of the early 20th century.

**Key Observations:**

*   **Children:** There are around 25 children in the image, ranging from young boys to older girls.
*   **Adults:** Two adults stand on either side of the group, one male and one female. The man is wearing a suit while the woman wears a dress appropriate for her time period.

**Conclusion:**

Based on their clothing and hairstyles, it can be inferred that this photograph was taken sometime between 1900-1950. However, without more specific information or context about the location where the photo was taken (e.g., school, church), it's difficult to pinpoint an exact date within those decades.
