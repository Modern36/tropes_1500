The photograph shows a man and woman sitting on a bench in front of a house. The man is wearing dark pants, a white shirt with rolled-up sleeves, and a vest or apron over his shirt. He has a hat on his head and appears to be holding something in his right hand, possibly a tool or object related to his work.

The woman is wearing a long dress with an apron over it, which was typical attire for women during that time period. She also wears a cap or bonnet on her head. Both individuals appear to be adults, likely in their middle age judging by their facial features and body language.

In the background of the photo, there are trees and other foliage visible behind the house, suggesting that it may have been taken outdoors rather than indoors. Overall, based on these observations, it seems likely that this photograph was taken around 1900-1920 given the style of clothing worn by both subjects as well as architectural details visible in the image itself such as windowsills and doorframes etcetera.
