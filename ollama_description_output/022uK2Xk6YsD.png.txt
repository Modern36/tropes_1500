There do not appear to be any people visible in this photograph. There may have been some people present when the photograph was taken but they cannot be seen in the image.

The image depicts a black-and-white photograph of a truck parked next to a large stack of sacks, with several men standing around it. The truck is positioned on the left side of the image, and the sacks are piled high behind it. Several men are gathered around the truck, some of whom appear to be loading or unloading the sacks. 

The background of the image shows a warehouse or storage facility, with rows of shelves and crates visible in the distance. The overall atmosphere suggests a busy industrial setting, possibly during World War II given the style of clothing worn by the men.
