There are no people visible in this photograph. The image appears to be a black-and-white illustration or drawing of a building with a sign that reads "Anders Strandberg" above the entrance. The building has a storefront on the left side, and there is a window on the right side. There are no individuals present in the scene.

The lack of people in the image suggests that it may be an architectural rendering or a historical illustration rather than a photograph taken at a specific moment in time.
