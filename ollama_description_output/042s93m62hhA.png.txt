There does not appear to be any people visible in this image. The photograph depicts a black-and-white interior scene featuring a framed painting on the left side, which appears to be a landscape or still life rather than a portrait of individuals. On the right side, there are two tapestries hanging from the wall. In front of these tapestries is a chair with an upholstered seat and backrest, accompanied by a small table positioned in front of it. The background consists of a white wall adorned with a picture frame at the top, while the floor features a rug with a floral pattern.

Upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that none of the elements within this scene depict people. Therefore, based on the content of the image, there are no individuals present to describe.
