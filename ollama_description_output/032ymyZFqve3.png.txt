The image depicts two babies lying on a fur rug, with their faces blurred for privacy reasons. The infants are dressed in white outfits adorned with lace and ribbons, suggesting they may be twins or siblings being photographed together. A woman sits behind them, wearing a dark dress that appears to be from the early 20th century based on its style. She has her hands placed gently on the babies' heads, indicating a maternal figure such as their mother or nanny.

In the background, there is another person who seems to be assisting with the photo shoot; however, due to the blurriness of the image, it's challenging to determine this individual's gender or exact role in the scene. The overall atmosphere suggests a formal family portrait taken during an era when such photographs were considered special occasions and required careful preparation.

Given these observations, there are at least three people visible in the picture: two babies (whose genders cannot be determined due to their age) and one adult female figure behind them. There might also be a fourth person assisting in the background, but further details about this individual remain unclear due to the image quality.
