The photograph features three men standing at different positions in front of a ruined structure with grass growing through the floor.

The man on the left is wearing a suit jacket and trousers with his arms crossed over his chest. He has dark hair, which is difficult to make out due to the low quality of the image. The middle man is dressed similarly but appears to be wearing a hat, although it's hard to discern any defining features from this distance.

The third man on the right wears what seems to be a lighter-colored shirt and darker trousers. His facial features are indistinguishable in the image. All three individuals appear to be adult men based on their attire and posture.
