The photograph depicts a single individual, an older man with white hair, seated at a table covered in papers and books. He is attired in a suit jacket, vest, shirt, tie, and trousers, accompanied by a pocket watch chain visible on his waistcoat.

In the background, two additional individuals are present: one standing behind the older man and another partially obscured by him. Both of these figures appear to be men based on their attire, which consists of suits and hats typical of the time period.

No children or women are discernible in the image. The scene suggests a professional or academic setting, possibly an office or study, given the presence of books and papers.
