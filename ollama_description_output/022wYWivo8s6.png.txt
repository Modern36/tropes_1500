The image depicts a woman with short hair, wearing a dress and pearl necklace. She is holding a hat in her right hand and appears to be looking at something off-camera.

In the background, there are no other people visible. The focus of the photograph is solely on the woman, and she takes up most of the frame. There are no individuals who can only partially be seen or whose faces cannot be identified due to being out of focus or obscured by objects.
