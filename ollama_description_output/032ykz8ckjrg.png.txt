The photograph features a young boy and girl seated on a chair, with the boy positioned on the left side of the image. The boy has short hair and is dressed in dark trousers and shoes, complemented by a white shirt adorned with a tie featuring a subtle pattern. He wears a long-sleeved jacket that appears to be made from wool or a similar material.

The girl, situated on the right side of the image, sports a bobbed haircut and is attired in a dress with a floral pattern. Her attire includes dark stockings and shoes, adding a touch of elegance to her overall appearance.

Both children are seated on a wooden chair, which appears to be positioned against a plain backdrop. The absence of any discernible background elements suggests that the photograph was taken in a studio setting. Notably, there are no other individuals visible in the image beyond the two children.
