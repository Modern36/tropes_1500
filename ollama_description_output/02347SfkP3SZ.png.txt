The photograph shows a large airship hangar with a crowd of people gathered outside it. The majority of the individuals appear to be men, although some women can also be seen in the image.

In the foreground, there are several men standing near the entrance of the hangar, wearing suits and hats typical of the early 20th century. Some of them have their hands on their hips or are holding objects such as tools or equipment. Behind this group, a few women can be seen walking towards the camera, dressed in long skirts and blouses with hats on their heads.

To the right side of the image, there is another group of people standing near what appears to be a small building or shed. This group consists mainly of men, but one woman can also be identified among them. In the background, several other individuals are visible, including children playing in the grassy area outside the hangar.

Overall, while the majority of the people depicted in this photograph are men, there is a notable presence of women and children as well.
