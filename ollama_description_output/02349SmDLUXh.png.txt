There are no people visible in this photograph. The top image appears to show a building with a sign above the door, possibly indicating it as a post office or similar establishment. However, there are no individuals present in either the foreground or background of the image.

The bottom image depicts a rural landscape featuring trees and houses but does not include any human figures. It seems to be an old photograph capturing scenes from everyday life during that time period; however, it lacks any depiction of people within its frame.
