The image depicts a black-and-white photograph of a building with a flagpole and a maypole in front, set against a backdrop of trees. The scene appears to be from an earlier time period, likely before color photography became widespread.

Upon examining the image closely, it is evident that there are no individuals visible within the frame. The focus of the photograph seems to be on capturing the architectural features and surroundings rather than human subjects. As such, I cannot identify any people in this particular photograph based on their clothing or other distinguishing characteristics.
