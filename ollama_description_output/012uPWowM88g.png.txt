The photograph features two children standing in the snow, dressed in winter attire. The child on the left wears a dark coat with white buttons, while the other is clad in a lighter-colored coat. Both children have hats and gloves, indicating that they are prepared for cold weather.

In the background, there appears to be a house or building partially obscured by trees and bushes. Additionally, what seems to be a car can be seen parked near the structure. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a winter scene with snow-covered ground and bare trees visible in the distance.

It is difficult to determine whether the individuals depicted are men, women, or children based solely on their clothing. However, given their small stature and youthful appearance, it is likely that they are indeed children.
