The image does not include any information about the location where it was taken. It is possible that the photograph was used as part of a historical collection related to urban planning, architecture, or environmental studies.

It's worth noting that the absence of people in the image could be due to various factors, such as the time of day when the photo was taken (e.g., early morning or late evening), the location being a less populated area, or the photographer intentionally avoiding capturing individuals. Without more context or information about the specific circumstances surrounding the taking of this photograph, it is difficult to provide further insight into why people are not present in the scene.
