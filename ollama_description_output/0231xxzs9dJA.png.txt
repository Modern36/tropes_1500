The image appears to depict a group of 19 men standing outside a building, posing for a photograph. They are all dressed in formal attire, consisting of dark suits with long coats and trousers, complemented by ties and hats. The men's ages seem to range from middle-aged to elderly.

In the background, there is a large building with multiple windows on each floor. A clock is visible above the entrance door, although its face is not discernible due to the image quality. On the right side of the photograph, some trees are partially obscured by the men and the building's facade.

There do not appear to be any children or women in this picture. All individuals present seem to be adult males.
