The photograph shows a large group of young girls standing outside a building with brick walls and arched windows. The girls are all wearing similar white dresses and hats, suggesting they may be part of a school or religious group.

In the foreground, one girl stands out as she holds a bouquet of flowers in her right hand. Her dress is slightly different from the others, possibly indicating that she has a specific role or status within the group. The other girls are arranged behind her in rows, with some looking directly at the camera and others gazing off to the side.

The background of the image features a large stone building with arched windows and doors. The walls appear to be made of brick or stone blocks, giving the structure a solid and imposing appearance. A few trees and bushes are visible on either side of the building, adding some greenery to the scene.

Overall, the photograph captures a moment in time when these young girls were gathered together outside this historic building, likely for a special occasion or event. The image provides insight into their lives during that era and offers a glimpse into the past through its detailed depiction of clothing, architecture, and setting.
