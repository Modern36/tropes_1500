The image shows a black-and-white photograph of a man sitting on a chair with his hands resting on the armrests. 

He is wearing a dark jacket, white shirt and bow tie. He has short hair that is combed back from his face. The man appears to be looking directly at the camera.

The background of the image is out of focus, but it seems to be an interior space with what could be curtains or drapes behind him. There are no other people visible in the photograph.
