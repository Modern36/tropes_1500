The photograph features a single individual, identified as a woman due to her attire. She is dressed in a long coat or dress that falls below her knees, which was typical for women's fashion during the time period when this image was taken. The presence of a hat on her head further supports the identification of gender based on clothing choices.

In addition to the main subject, there are no other people visible in the background or foreground of the photograph. The focus remains solely on the woman standing in front of the trees and grassy area, with no discernible figures beyond her.
