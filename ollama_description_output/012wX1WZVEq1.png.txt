The photograph depicts two individuals engaged in sweeping a dock or pier, possibly as part of a cleanup effort. The image is in black and white, which makes it challenging to discern specific details about their attire or physical characteristics.

**Clothing:**
Both figures wear long-sleeved shirts and pants, with one individual donning a hat. Their clothing appears practical for manual labor tasks such as sweeping.

**Physical Characteristics:**
Due to the quality of the image and its black-and-white nature, it is difficult to determine any distinct physical features like facial structure, hair color, or body shape that could help identify gender.

**Activity:**
They are both actively involved in cleaning the dock area using brooms. This activity suggests they might be workers responsible for maintaining cleanliness at the location depicted.

**Background and Context:**
The background of the image shows what appears to be a harbor or waterfront area with ships and other structures visible but out of focus. This setting implies that the individuals' work is related to maritime activities, possibly as dockworkers or cleaners.

Given these observations:

*   **Gender Identification:** It is not possible to definitively identify the gender of either person based solely on this photograph due to its limitations.
*   **Occupation/Role:** They seem to be involved in maintenance or cleaning tasks at a waterfront location, suggesting they could be dockworkers, cleaners, or engaged in similar roles.

In summary, while it's clear that there are two individuals performing a task of sweeping outdoors near watercraft, their gender cannot be accurately determined from the provided black-and-white photograph.
