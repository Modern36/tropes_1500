The image shows a black and white portrait of an older man dressed in formal attire.

He is wearing a dark suit with a high collar shirt and tie and appears to be balding, with little hair visible on his head. He has a thin moustache and he is looking directly at the camera. The background of the photograph is plain so there are no people or objects other than the subject to describe.

It appears that he may have been wearing glasses as some kind of frame can be seen around his eyes, but they do not appear in the photograph, possibly because they were removed before it was taken.
