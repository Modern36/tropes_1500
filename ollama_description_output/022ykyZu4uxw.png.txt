The photograph depicts a scene from an indoor market or store, with three men standing near a counter displaying various vegetables and fruits. The man on the left is wearing a light-colored suit jacket over a white shirt and tie, while the man in the middle has on a dark-colored suit jacket paired with a white shirt and no tie. The third man, positioned to the right of the image, sports a light-colored suit jacket complemented by a white shirt and tie.

In the background, there are several other individuals who appear to be customers or vendors at the market. One person is partially obscured by a stack of crates, but they seem to be wearing casual clothing such as jeans and a t-shirt. Another individual can be seen walking towards the camera from the right side of the frame; this person appears to be dressed in business attire, consisting of a suit jacket and dress pants.

Overall, based on their attire alone, it seems that all of these individuals are adults rather than children.
