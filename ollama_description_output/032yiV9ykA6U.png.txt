The image depicts a winter scene with several buildings in the background, but there are no people visible anywhere within it. The photograph appears to be focused on showcasing architectural structures rather than capturing human activity or presence.

Given this observation, I must conclude that there are no men, women, children, persons, or people present in the provided image.
