The photograph shows a man and woman dressed for their wedding. The woman is seated on the left side of the image wearing a white dress and veil with a floral headpiece. She holds a bouquet of flowers in her right hand, which rests on her lap.

Standing to her right is the man who wears a dark suit with a light shirt and tie. His left hand rests on the back of the woman's chair while his right arm hangs by his side.

In the background behind them are two men dressed similarly but without hats or ties. One stands behind the seated couple, and one in front leaning against a wall to their right. There is another person standing at the far end of the room near a doorway who appears to be wearing dark clothing as well.

On either side of this group sit several women also attired in formal attire; some wear hats while others do not have any head coverings visible due to being partially obscured from view by other people or objects within frame.
