There do not appear to be any people visible in this photograph. The image shows a body of water with several boats or ships in the distance, but no individuals can be seen on land or on the vessels. Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether there are men, women, children, or other types of people present in the scene.

It's worth noting that the photograph may have been taken from a distance or at an angle that obscures any potential human figures. Additionally, the image quality and resolution may not be high enough to reveal subtle details such as people standing on the shore or walking along the dock. Overall, based on the available information, it appears that there are no discernible people in this photograph.
