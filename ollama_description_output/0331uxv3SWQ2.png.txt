The photograph depicts a man standing with his back to the camera, wearing a dark coat and hat. He is holding up one arm towards a tramcar in front of him.

In the background, there appears to be at least three other people visible: 

*   A person on the street behind the tram, who seems to be observing the scene.
*   Another individual standing near the edge of the image, possibly waiting for or boarding another tram.
*   Someone inside the tramcar that the main subject is addressing, although their features are not discernible due to distance and focus.

All individuals in this photograph appear to be adults.
