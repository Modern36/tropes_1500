There appear to be two people visible in this photograph, both standing in the foreground. The person on the left appears to be a woman wearing a dark dress with a white apron over it, and her hair tied up under a cap. She appears to have a basket or bag hanging from her right arm. To her right is a man, wearing dark trousers and a light-colored shirt tucked into them. He has a tie on and his sleeves are rolled up to just below the elbow. His left hand rests in the pocket of his trousers while he holds the handle of what looks like a large bucket with his other hand. Neither person's face can be made out clearly, but judging by their clothing it appears they may be dressed for work or some kind of outdoor activity. 

There are no people visible in the background of this photograph.
