In this black-and-white photograph, a group of six individuals sit on the shore of a lake or river, surrounded by trees and rocks. The image appears slightly blurry, making it difficult to discern specific details about each person.

On the left side of the photo, four people are seated on a blanket or sheet spread out on the ground. One person is wearing what seems to be a dress, while another individual wears light-colored pants. Two other individuals appear to be dressed in darker attire, but their clothing is not clearly visible due to the blurriness of the image.

Behind this group, two more people can be seen standing up and looking towards the camera. One person appears to be wearing a dark jacket or coat, while the other individual's clothing is indistinguishable.

In the background, several trees are visible along the shoreline, with some branches extending over the water. A few rocks are also scattered throughout the scene.

Overall, it is challenging to determine the gender of the individuals in this photograph due to its blurry quality and the limited visibility of their facial features and clothing. However, based on their attire, it appears that there may be both men and women present in the image.
