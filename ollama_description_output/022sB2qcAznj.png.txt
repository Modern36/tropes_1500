The image presents a black-and-white photograph of an elderly woman seated in a chair, captured from the waist up. Her hair is styled in a short bob, and she wears a dark-colored dress adorned with a brooch at her neckline. The dress features intricate embroidery or other decorative elements on its front.

In the background, there are no visible people; however, it appears that she may be situated within an interior setting, possibly indoors.
