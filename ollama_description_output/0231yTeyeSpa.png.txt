There are no people visible in this photograph. The image depicts a black train engine with the number "20" on its side, emitting smoke from its chimney as it travels along tracks surrounded by trees and bushes. In the background, there appears to be a body of water or a lake.

Given that there are no individuals present in the scene, I cannot provide any information about their gender identity based on clothing.
