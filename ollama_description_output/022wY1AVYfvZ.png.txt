The photograph depicts a serene scene of horses drinking from a stream, with two individuals standing nearby. The person on the left is dressed in dark attire and appears to be male, while the person on the right wears light-colored clothing and could also be male or female.

In the background, there are no other people visible. The focus of the image is primarily on the horses and the natural surroundings, with the two individuals present but not being the main subject of the photograph.
