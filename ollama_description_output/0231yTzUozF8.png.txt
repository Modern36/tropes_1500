There do not appear to be any people visible in this image. The photograph depicts a black-and-white scene of what appears to be an old railroad yard or train station area, with several small buildings and structures scattered throughout the area. In the foreground, there are railroad tracks that run horizontally across the image, with a few trains parked along the tracks.
