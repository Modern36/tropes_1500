The photograph does not depict any individuals. It appears to be a black-and-white image of an empty train station or railroad tracks with buildings in the background. There are no visible people in the foreground, middle ground, or background areas of the photo. The focus seems to be on capturing the scene of the train station rather than including human subjects.
