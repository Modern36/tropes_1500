The photograph shows a black-and-white winter scene with snow on the ground. There appear to be eight men standing outside in the photograph.

Seven of these men can be seen facing away from the camera, towards what appears to be a bridge or an embankment, next to a car. They are all wearing long coats and hats that appear to be made of fur. One person is partially obscured by the others as they stand together, but their hat appears similar in style.

The eighth man can be seen on the left side of the photograph, walking away from the group towards another bridge or embankment. He also wears a long coat and what looks like a fedora hat.

There do not appear to be any women or children in this photograph.
