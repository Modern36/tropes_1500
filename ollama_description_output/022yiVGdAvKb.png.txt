The photograph depicts a horse-drawn carriage with four individuals inside. The person on the left appears to be an adult woman wearing a light-colored dress and hat, while the individual next to her seems to be another woman dressed in darker attire. In the back seat, there are two children: one boy sitting upright and another child leaning against him. Notably, all of these figures are out of focus.

In the background, several people can be seen standing near trees or buildings, although they are not clearly visible due to their distance from the camera. Additionally, some individuals appear to be walking along a path behind the carriage, but again, their features are indistinct.

It is worth noting that the photograph's quality makes it challenging to discern specific details about each person's appearance beyond their general outline and positioning within the scene.
