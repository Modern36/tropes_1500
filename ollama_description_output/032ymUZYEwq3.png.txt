There do not appear to be any people visible in this image. The picture shows a large astronomical clock inside a cathedral or similar building, surrounded by empty chairs on either side. This suggests that the photo was taken when no religious services or other events were taking place there.

The image appears to be an old black-and-white photograph showing the interior of a church with a large clock tower in the center and pews facing the camera on both sides. The overall atmosphere seems formal, suggesting it might have been captured during a quiet moment before or after a service when no one was present except possibly for someone taking the photo from the back pew.

Given these observations, there are no individuals to describe as they do not appear in the image at all.
