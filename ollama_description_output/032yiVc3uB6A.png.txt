The image shows a group of 11 people standing in front of a line of trees. They are all wearing coats and hats, suggesting that it may be cold outside. The people appear to be adults, with no children visible.

In terms of gender, most of the individuals seem to be men, as evidenced by their attire and hairstyles. However, there is one person on the far right who appears to be a woman, based on her clothing and hairstyle. It's worth noting that the image quality makes it difficult to discern certain features, so this identification may not be entirely accurate.

There are no people in the background or out of focus that can be clearly identified as male, female, or child. The main focus of the image is the group of people standing together, and they are all relatively well-defined within the frame.
