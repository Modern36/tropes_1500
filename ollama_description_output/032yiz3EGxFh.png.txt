The photograph depicts a black-and-white scene of a cobblestone street with buildings on either side. In the foreground, a man stands in the center of the road, wearing a dark uniform and cap, holding his right arm outstretched towards the camera. He appears to be directing traffic or signaling something.

Behind him, several people are visible walking along the sidewalk or standing outside shops. To the left, a group of four men can be seen near a building with a sign that reads "Svenska Handelsbanken." One of these men is wearing a light-colored suit and hat, while another has a dark jacket and no headgear. A third man wears a lighter-colored jacket, but his face is not clearly visible. The fourth man in this group is partially obscured by the others.

On the opposite side of the street, two women are walking together, both dressed in long coats and hats. One woman carries an umbrella, suggesting that it may be raining or overcast outside. Further down the sidewalk, a man stands alone, looking towards the camera with his hands clasped behind his back. He is attired in a dark suit and hat.

In addition to these individuals, there are several other people visible in the background of the photograph. Some are walking along the street, while others stand outside shops or buildings. Although their features are not clearly defined due to the distance and quality of the image, they add depth and context to the scene.

Overall, the majority of the people depicted in this photograph appear to be adults, with no children visible. The men generally wear suits and hats, indicating that they may be businessmen or professionals. The women's attire suggests a more formal occasion or social event. Given the time period and setting, it is likely that most of these individuals are from middle-class backgrounds.
