There do not appear to be any people visible within this image, as it depicts an empty landscape with no signs of human activity or figures. The scene is dominated by natural elements such as trees, grass, and a body of water, which suggests that the photograph was taken in a rural or wilderness area.

Since there are no individuals present in the image, it is not possible to determine their gender based on clothing or other visual cues. Therefore, I will refer to them simply as "people" if they were present, but since they are not, this description does not apply.

In summary, the photograph shows a serene natural landscape devoid of any human presence, making it impossible to identify individuals or their genders within the scene.
