There does not appear to be any people present in this image. 

The photograph shows a black-and-white picture of a folding stool or seat made of metal tubing with a plastic seat. The seat is white and has a subtle texture, possibly indicating it's made from plastic or vinyl. It rests on four legs that are splayed outwards for stability, with the front two legs being slightly shorter than the back ones to create an incline for comfort while sitting.

In the background, there appears to be a wall or backdrop which seems to have some texture or pattern but is not clearly visible due to the low resolution and focus of the image. There are no other objects or people present in the scene.
