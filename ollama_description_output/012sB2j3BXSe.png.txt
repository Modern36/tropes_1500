The photograph shows a young girl sitting on a chair. She has light-colored hair styled in two braids, one on each side of her head, and is wearing a white dress with small dark polka dots. Her socks are light-colored and she's wearing Mary Jane shoes that are black with a strap across the top.

The background of the photograph is out of focus but appears to be an interior room with a wall and floor. The overall atmosphere suggests a formal portrait setting, possibly taken in a studio or at home during the early 20th century when this style of photography was common.
