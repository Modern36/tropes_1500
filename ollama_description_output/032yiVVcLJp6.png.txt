This black-and-white photograph depicts a group of people congregated outdoors in a snowy setting, with trees visible in the background. The individuals are dressed warmly, wearing coats and hats or head coverings.

In the foreground, several children stand together, while one person stands alone to the left of the group. Another individual is partially obscured by the right edge of the photograph.

The attire worn by the people in this image does not provide sufficient information to determine their gender with certainty. Therefore, it is appropriate to refer to them as 'people' or 'individuals'.
