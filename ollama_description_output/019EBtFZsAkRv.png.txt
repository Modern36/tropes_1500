The photograph depicts a young boy dressed in a military-style uniform with epaulets on his shoulders, standing against a white backdrop. He has short hair and wears shiny black shoes, dark trousers, a white shirt with a tie, and a jacket adorned with medals or badges. The boy's sleeves are rolled up to just below his elbows.

In the background, there is another person who appears to be an adult male wearing a suit, but they are out of focus and not clearly visible.
