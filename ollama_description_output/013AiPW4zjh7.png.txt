The photograph features a young child, likely a girl, sitting on the floor with a teddy bear and a doll. The child is dressed in a dark dress adorned with white polka dots, complemented by knee-high socks and Mary Jane shoes. Her hair is styled in pigtails secured with bows.

In the background, there appears to be another person or people present but they are out of focus and difficult to discern any defining features beyond the fact that they seem to be wearing dark clothing.
