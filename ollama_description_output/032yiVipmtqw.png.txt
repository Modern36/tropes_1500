There are no people visible in this photograph. The image depicts a large ship on the water, with trees and buildings in the background. The sky is cloudy, but there appears to be some sunlight coming through the clouds. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests that it was taken during the daytime, possibly in the late afternoon or early evening.

The absence of people in the photograph makes it difficult to determine any specific details about them. However, based on the context and setting of the image, it is likely that the people who were present when the photo was taken were either sailors or passengers on the ship, or individuals living or working near the waterfront.
